-f                # if destination file cannot be opened, remove and try 
```

~/Linux/Old/!(Tux.png) ~/Linux/New/
```

```

> rmdir

* remove directory

> mkdir

* Create directory

```sh
-p dir1/dir2    # nested directory
```

```

> unlink

unlink linked-file

file | grep -vi "the"   # Print files with line the 
/etc/*-release          # Prints linux distribution
file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt  # Merge two files into one
```

> head [filename]
