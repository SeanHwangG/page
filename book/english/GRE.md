The author must take into consideration other explanations for _____.
An alternative for ______ needs to be taken into account.
Lastly, the author needs to consider other possible explanations for _____.

First, the author must take into account other explanations for the results of the first and second study and the different conditions of each study to prove a decline in amphibians. It is entirely possible that the first study was conducted for one year and the second study was conducted for a week. In this case, the second study might have observed fewer amphibians not because they actually reduced, but because the researchers did not have enough time to find them due to the time restrictions and study limitations. Also, it is plausible that the first study may have been conducted by a group of experts in the field and the second study was done by a group of college students specializing in a completely different field. If this were the case, it is more likely that the experts would have found more species of amphibians because of their expertise and knowledge compared to the amateurs. In other words, the second study may not actually indicate a decrease in amphibians.

An alternative for the decline in amphibians needs to be considered by discussing the credibility of the observation in 2002. The author states that the number of species decreased; however, it is likely that the numbers of amphibians did not actually reduce. Instead, the researchers simply may not have been able to find the amphibians. Since the argument states that the number of amphibians observed decreased, this does not indicate that they declined in actuality.

Lastly, the author needs to take into consideration other possible explanations for the decline in the number of amphibians besides the introduction of trout. In all likelihood, the amphibians decreased not because of the introduction of the trout, but because of other factors, such as humans, an environmental factor, or lack of food. In particular, hunters could have killed the amphibians for industrial purposes. Also, the environment could have rapidly changed, so the amphibians were not able to adjust to the climate changes. In addition, other predators could have negatively affected the amphibians themselves, so the amphibian eggs were not negatively affected. Other predators, not trout, resulted in the decline of amphibians.

To bolster it, the author needs to think about the alternative explanations for _____.

In brief, the author’s claim is not persuasive on many grounds. In order to strengthen the argument, the author should provide more solid data on the two studies and reconsider other possibilities that could have yielded the decline in amphibians.

The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a scientific journal.

"A recent study of eighteen rhesus monkeys provides clues as to the effects of birth order on an individual's levels of stimulation. The study showed that in stimulating situations (such as an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey), firstborn infant monkeys produce up to twice as much of the hormone cortisol, which primes the body for increased activity levels, as do their younger siblings. Firstborn humans also produce relatively high levels of cortisol in stimulating situations (such as the return of a parent after an absence). The study also found that during pregnancy, first-time mother monkeys had higher levels of cortisol than did those who had had several offspring."

[brainstorm]
Firstborn infant monkeys produced twice the amount because they were older and have bigger bodies.

Eighteen monkeys are a marginal number and twice the amount may not be a substantial amount to substantiate the argument.
Then, the survey results and the responses may not be credible because it was a sheer coincidence.
Firstborn and the younger siblings should be tested when they are the same age and have similar body structures.

The firstborn infant monkeys produced more hormone because of their characters

Not only the stimulating situations of humans and monkeys are not similar, but also each individual's stimulating situation is different.
Due to their higher cognitive ability they are able to sense the possible danger younger siblings tend to be careless and less anxious about the surroundings
Emotional attachment of parents
Whether the  was expecting or not or he got a sudden shock of stimulation

higher cortisol level during pregnancy is not due to the child.

The unique conditions during pregnancy might cause higher cortisol levels for pregnant mothers.
They might have been busy in taking care of the children rather than feeling nervous or because they have gone through this phase before and are pretty confident this time.

[essay_ann]

	In the letter, the author states that birth order determines an individual’s levels of stimulation. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of explanations for increased activity levels of monkeys leads me to question the validity of the argument.

	First, the author must take into consideration other explanations for the doubled levels of stimulation of firstborn monkeys as revealed in the study. The author trusts the recent study conducted on eighteen rhesus monkeys. However, it is possible that the eighteen monkeys are a marginal number and are not credible. It is also plausible that the initial amount of cortisol that the firstborn infant monkeys produced was negligible. Twice the amount may not be a substantial amount, so firstborn monkeys did not have significantly higher levels of stimulation. In addition, clues are not actual evidence. It may be highly possible that first born infant monkeys produce more cortisol than younger siblings because they are older and have stronger bodies. Their bigger and stronger bodies may have led to higher levels of stimulation. For a more accurate comparison, the firstborn and the younger siblings should be tested when they are the same age and have similar body structures. In other words, birth order may not determine stimulation levels.

An alternative for the high levels of cortisol of firstborn humans needs to be taken into account. It must be noted that the conditions of monkeys cannot be generalized as the conditions of humans. In particular, the stimulating situation of monkeys was an encounter with an unfamiliar monkey; however, the stimulating situation of humans was with familiar people - their parents. The stimulating situations of monkeys and humans are not similar, so birth order may not determine stimulation levels in humans.

	Lastly, the author needs to consider other possible explanations for the higher cortisol levels of the first-time mother monkeys during pregnancy. Without detailed statistics of the higher levels of cortisol, the difference may be marginal. Thus, the difference between the levels of cortisol in first-time mother monkeys and those who had several offspring may not be significant. Even if the levels of cortisol are substantial, it cannot be guaranteed that the cortisol of the first-time mother monkeys will be delivered to first born infant monkeys. Since the higher cortisol levels occurred for pregnant mothers, this may be possible only because of the unique conditions during pregnancy. It may not apply to first born monkeys.

	In brief, the author’s claim on the causal relationship between birth order and high stimulation levels is unconvincing. To bolster it, the author needs to think about the alternative explanations for the monkeys’ increased activity levels.

The following appeared in a health newsletter.

"A ten-year nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a helmet while bicycling indicates that ten years ago, approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets, whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent. Another study, however, suggests that during the same ten-year period, the number of bicycle-related accidents has increased by 200 percent. These results demonstrate that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets, and they take more risks as a result. Thus, to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents, the government should concentrate more on educating people about bicycle safety and less on encouraging or requiring bicyclists to wear helmets."
```

```
[essay_ann]

In the health newsletter, the author argues that the government should place more emphasis on educating people about bicycle safety and less emphasis on requiring bicyclists to wear helmets. He makes this argument based on the results of two studies. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the unsubstantiated assumptions lead me to question its validity.

First, the author assumes that today more people wear helmets because currently 80% of bicyclists wear helmets compared to 35% ten years ago. However, it is possible that ten years ago the number of bicyclists was substantial, and currently the number of bicyclists has decreased. In such a case, 80% of bicyclists could actually pale in comparison with 35% of bicyclists wearing helmets, and 80% can be seen as a negligible number of bicyclists wearing helmets. Thus, currently fewer people may be wearing helmets.

Another assumption the author makes is that helmets are not effective since the number of bicycle-related accidents increased during the same ten-year period. However, it is plausible that the number of accidents increased not due to ineffective helmets, but due to other reasons, such as the risk-taking drivers or adverse weather conditions. Bicyclists are not the problem, and drivers and their risky actions might be the actual causes of accidents. Helmets may actually be effective, and bicyclists are not feeling safe and not taking risks due to helmet usage. Also, without further specific statistical data, it may be likely that the initial number of accidents was marginal. Therefore, a 200% increase in accidents caused by bicycling may not be a significant increase, so the accidents should not be considered a pressing issue.

Lastly, the author assumes that wearing helmets is not helping so the government should focus less on the requirement of helmet usage and more on bicycle education. He further believes this would reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents. He adamantly believes that only one of the two methods is effective. Nevertheless, it cannot be hatily deduced that the positive aspects of bicycle education override the necessity of helmet usage. After all, bicycle safety education should go hand-in-hand with the usage of helmets. In all likelihood, there are other ways to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents. There are other types of protective gear, such as knee pads and glow-in-the-dark wristbands, so the usage of helmets should not be the sole focus.

In summary, the author’s argument on the ineffectiveness of bicyclists wearing helmets is unconvincing. To strengthen the argument, the author should provide detailed statistics on the two studies.

In an attempt to improve highway safety, Prunty County last year lowered its speed limit from 55 to 45 miles per hour on all county highways. But this effort has failed: the number of accidents has not decreased, and, based on reports by the highway patrol, many drivers are exceeding the speed limit. Prunty County should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that Butler County completed five years ago: increasing lane widths, resurfacing rough highways, and improving visibility at dangerous intersections. Today, major Butler County roads still have a 55 mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in Butler County this past year than there were five years ago.

[Essay_Sean]

In the argument, the author suggests undertaking the road improvement project that Butler Country completed five years ago. He provides the failed effort in decreasing the speed limits and Butler Country’s successful project as his pieces of evidence. However, he needs to provide more evidence to make a compelling argument.

First, the author needs to provide solid evidence that the effort has really failed. He reasons that the number of accidents has not decreased and many drivers are exceeding the speed limits. However, it might be the case that the number of drivers has significantly increased. Then, even though there were more numbered accidents, the accident rate might have been lowered. Also, there should be a detailed explanation about speeding drivers. There might be much more drivers who follow the speed limits, so one cannot hastily conclude that people are not following speed limits.

On top of that, one must consider the geographical difference between Butler and Prunty County. To be specific, five years ago, the road condition of Butler County might have been much worse than the current road in Prunty County. If so, road improvement projects in Prunty Country will not yield the same positive impact. Thus, instead of refurbishing roads, Prunty Country should consider different options such as making more traffic signs and building some additional expressway rest areas.

Lastly, the more concrete evidence is needed on the degree of the accidents. Even if Butler Country has fewer number of reported accidents, it is possible that those accidents were more critical and caused many injuries. Therefore, the author must provide details about the number of casualties and total damages associated with recent accidents. Also, the author should not generalize major Butler Country roads as all roads in Butler Country. If most of the accidents in Butler Country were occurred in major roads - especially, most of them are due to speeding - steeding a speed limit is more effective than road improvements. 

	In brief, the author’s argument is unconvincing. To bolster the argument, it should make a valid comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of Delany and Walsh.

Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean'' basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.
```

Condition of the river might have changed over time.

The river used to be very shallow, so it is obvious that ancient people could easily pass the river without any boats. There could be no river in the ancient at all

Paleon boats are not the only method to cross the river.

Lithos people imported the basket using their own boats.
Good at swimming, the basket could have been transported by people who swam.
Existing bridge but ruined by flood and then no longer exists today.

the fact that no Palean boat has been found does not mean there is no evidence about boat

Archaeologists may not be obtained with sophisticated tools to detect the ancient relics of boats.
The Palean boats might be made of disposable materials like wood in ancient times.

According to a recent report, cheating among college and university students is on the rise. However, Groveton College has successfully reduced student cheating by adopting an honor code, which calls for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced a system in which teachers closely monitored students; under that system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without. Thus, all colleges and universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton in order to decrease cheating among students.

Evidence suggests that academic honor codes, which call for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated, are far more successful than are other methods at deterring cheating among students at colleges and universities. Several years ago, Groveton College adopted such a code and discontinued its old-fashioned system in which teachers closely monitored students. Under the old system, teachers reported an average of thirty cases of cheating per year. In the first year the honor code was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.

Moreover, in a recent survey, a majority of Groveton students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without. Such evidence suggests that all colleges and universities should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's. This change is sure to result in a dramatic decline in cheating among college students.

Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams Realty."

[essay_ann]

	In the letter, the homeowner states that his friend should use Adams if he wants to sell his home quickly and at a good price. At first glance, the argument seems persuasive; however, some assumptions lead readers to question its validity.

	First, the homeowner unfairly assumes that Adams’ service overrides Fitch’s service because Adams has 40 real estate agents and Fitch has 25 agents with the majority working part-time. However, it is possible that the 40 agents from Adams are novices. On the other hand, the 25 agents from Fitch are properly trained, productive, and experienced. In such a case, the quantity of agents does not necessarily indicate their quality. Also, the number of part-time workers in Adams was not mentioned. Although Fitch has many part-time workers, it is plausible that Adams has more part-timers. Then, Fitch’s 25 part-time workers may not reveal its inferiority.

	Other unwarranted assumptions made by the homeowner are that Adams is superior because Adams’ revenue last year was twice that of Fitch and home sales of Adams averaged $168,000 compared to Fitch’s $144,000. It is likely that twice the revenue last year was an aberration. If the high revenue does not continue in the long run, Admas may not necessarily be better than Fitch. Moreover, the homeowner does not take into consideration the type of houses that each firm specializes in. It is very possible that Adams focuses on luxurious homes that are bigger and located in expensive locations,but Fitch focuses on the standard type of home in locations that are not readily accessible. In this case, it is only logical that Adams would sell their homes at higher prices, and Adams should not be seen as superior.

	The homeowner, furthermore, assumes that faster home sales of Adams last year indicate its superiority. However, in all likelihood, ten years ago, the economy was adverse, thereby having a detrimental effect on the housing market. Thus, Fitch took a long time to sell homes not due to its inferiority, but due to the adverse economic conditions ten years ago. Last year the prosperous economy may have helped Adam’s clients find buyers within a month. In addition, the personal experience of the homeowner cannot be generalized as the experience of all customers. Although the homeowner had a good experience with Adams, he cannot recommend using Adams to his friend and others who want to sell their homes and quickly and at a good price because they may have different experiences.

	In summary, the homeowner’s argument that clients should use Adams Realty to sell homes is not persuasive in many aspects. In order to bolster the argument, he should reconsider the above assumptions to prove that Adams is superior to Fitch.

Arctic deer live on islands in Canada's arctic regions. They search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of the year. Their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough, at least some of the year, for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands, allowing the deer to travel over it. Unfortunately, according to reports from local hunters, the deer populations are declining. Since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt, we can conclude that the purported decline in deer populations is the result of the deer's being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the argument, the author suggests that the decline in arctic deer populations is due to the deer being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea. He provides reports of local hunters and global warming trends as his pieces of evidence. However, he needs to provide more evidence to make a more compelling argument.

	To begin with, more specific evidence is needed on the credibility of the study results to prove that the deer actually declined. The reports from local hunters cannot be taken at face value. They, after all, may lack cutting-edge technology and expertise needed to accurately record the populations of the deer. Then, deer might not have decreased. Also, the exact decline of deer may be negligible, so the population decrease should not be seen as very significant. There is even a possibility that the deer population may even increase later.

	Furthermore, the author needs to add more concrete evidence on global warming trends that caused the sea ice to melt and the reports that appeared at the same time. Since the reports of decreased deer coincided with global warming trends, global warming could not have caused the decline. Although there may be a correlation between these two factors, there may not be a causal relationship between global warming and a decline in deer. In addition, since global warming trends are recent, global warming may not be strong enough to cause the ice to melt right away. In other words, global warming cannot melt the sea ice immediately, so the decline in deer should be viewed in the long run.

	Finally, more specific evidence is needed on the soundness of the conclusion that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea. It is quite possible that other factors, such as predators or a contagious disease, yielded the decline in deer. The existence of other bigger animals and outbreak of disease should be monitored. Besides global warming, other environmental factors or climate factors may have also led to the decrease in deer. Moreover, the hunters themselves - specifically the increase of hunters - may actually be the reason why deer populations have declined. Hunters may have recently felt the need to hunt more due to various reasons, such as means of subsistence and recreational activity.

	In summary, the author’s argument that global warming trends yielded the decrease in deer is not persuasive in many aspects. In order to strengthen the argument, he should add evidence on the reports made by hunters, provide information that global warming trends caused sea ice to melt quickly, and reconsider other possibilities for the decline of deer.

The following appeared in a memo from the director of student housing at Buckingham College.

"To serve the housing needs of our students, Buckingham College should build a number of new dormitories. Buckingham's enrollment is growing and, based on current trends, will double over the next 50 years, thus making existing dormitory space inadequate. Moreover, the average rent for an apartment in our town has risen in recent years. Consequently, students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus housing. Finally, attractive new dormitories would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham."

Fifteen years ago, Omega University implemented a new procedure that encouraged students to evaluate the teaching effectiveness of all their professors. Since that time, Omega professors have begun to assign higher grades in their classes, and overall student grade averages at Omega have risen by 30 percent. Potential employers, looking at this dramatic rise in grades, believe that grades at Omega are inflated and do not accurately reflect student achievement; as a result, Omega graduates have not been as successful at getting jobs as have graduated from nearby Alpha University. To enable its graduates to secure better jobs, Omega University should terminate student evaluation of professors.

In the argument, the author asserts that Omega University should terminate student evaluation of professors to enable its graduates to secure better jobs. He believes that student evaluation led to Omega students’ inflated grades and eventually their lack of success of getting jobs. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of evidence leads me to doubt the validity of the argument.

	First, the author needs to provide solid evidence that the new procedure to evaluate teaching effectiveness yielded the 30% increase in grades of Omega students. It is possible that students’ grades increased not due to the new procedure, but due to the increase in the quality of teaching of the professors. Thus, the teachers did not purposely give higher grades and instead they decided to teach better since they were being evaluated. Inflated grades may not be due to the student evaluation of professors. In addition, the argument stated that overall student grade averages have risen by 30%. However, if the initial grades were low, a 30% increase may not be such a significant increase. The teacher evaluation did not have a significantly adverse effect.

	Second, the author needs to supplement the argument with more concrete evidence that Omega students cannot readily obtain jobs because of the grade inflation of students. It is plausible that Omega graduates are not successful because of the students’ lack of talent, not because of the purposely higher grades. In particular, Omega students may have less work experience or unimpressive resumes, which hampered them from getting jobs. Also, Omega graduates might be extremely ambitious and desire to acquire only full-time, high salary positions, and this is the reason they cannot find jobs successfully. In such a case the grade inflation and Omega graduates' struggle in finding jobs would not be correlated. Grade inflation may not actually be a significant problem.

	Lastly, more specific evidence is needed on the intrinsic conditions of Omega and Alpha and the soundness of the conclusion that Omega should end evaluation of professors. It is likely that the reputation of Omega pales in comparison with that of Alpha. Omega may not be a prestigious school and might not have prominent professors, so it is only natural that graduates are not able to find jobs as quickly. Then, professor evaluation should not be terminated, and the quality of teaching should improve for graduates to secure better jobs.

In brief, the author’s claim to end student evaluation of teachers is flawed and unconvincing. The author needs to reconsider otherfacotrs that yielded the lower employment rate of Omega graduates, and he needs to add more pieces of evidence to make a stronger argument.



[19] [Recommendation]

Two years ago, radio station WCQP in Rockville decided to increase the number of call-in advice programs that it broadcast; since that time, its share of the radio audience in the Rockville listening area has increased significantly. Given WCQP's recent success with call-in advice programming, and citing a nationwide survey indicating that many radio listeners are quite interested in such programs, the station manager of KICK in Medway recommends that KICK include more call-in advice programs in an attempt to gain a larger audience share in its listening area.

[CR] Increase in the share is not due to the call-in advice => population, quality improved
[G] nationwide survey respondent does not represent prospect KICK audience
[IC] Interest ≠ View => radio hours are not convenient
[IC] KICK already have enough call-in advice programs
[Q&Q] More advice programs are not always better => good qualities of advice

The following is a memorandum from the business manager of a television station.

 "Over the past year, our late-night news program has devoted increased time to national news and less time to weather and local news. During this period, most of the complaints received from viewers were concerned with our station's coverage of weather and local news. In addition, local businesses that used to advertise during our late-night news program have canceled their advertising contracts with us. Therefore, in order to attract more viewers to our news programs and to avoid losing any further advertising revenues, we should expand our coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs."

[CR] adverse quality or inaccuracy of the new reports > less time to weather
[IC] In the long run, effective later on
[CR] businesses cancelled their advertising because of adverse economic conditions
[IC] Increased national news time yielded the cancellation and reduced viewers
[G] should expand the coverage of weather and local news on some programs 

In this memorandum, the business manager argues that the television station should expand its coverage of weather and local news. This is because many complaints were received and advertising contracts with local businesses were canceled. Although this argument may seem valid at first glance, the assumptions lead me to question the validity of the argument.

First, the business manager assumes that there is a causal relationship between less time devoted to weather and local news time over the past year and complaints received from viewers. It is possible that people complained because of the adverse quality or inaccuracy of the new reports, not because of reduced time. People may be dissatisfied with the content of the weather and local news and the delivery of the news reporter. In other words, a reduced time may not have been a pressing issue. Since the weather and local news time was reduced the past year, the manager should not hastily deduce that the change is ineffective. The results of the decreased time should be viewed in the long run because the reduction in weather and local news time may prove effective later on.

Second, the manager makes an assumption that the shortened new time yielded the cancellation of business contracts. It is plausible that local businesses canceled their advertising contracts because they were strapped for cash, not because they were dissatisfied with the reduced weather and local news time. The adverse economic conditions should be considered before assuming that decreasing time devoted to weather news is the problem. 

The last assumption the manager makes is that expanding the coverage of weather and local news on all news programs would help attract more viewers and avoid losing further advertising revenues. He believes that reduced time for weather and local news is the problem at hand. However, there might be a higher chance that people may be dissatisfied with the increased national news time. If this is the case, national news should be reduced, and the station should consider allocating more time to other programs. Also, expanding the coverage of weather and local news on some programs may be a sound conclusion. Although it may be effective on some programs, it cannot be generalized as all news programs.

In brief, the manager’s argument on the expansion of coverage of weather and local news is unsound on many grounds. To strengthen the argument, he needs to consider the nature of the complaints, the causes of cancellation of business contracts, and the soundness of the conclusion on all news programs.

The following appeared in an article written by Dr. Karp, an anthropologist.

"Twenty years ago, Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia and concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents. However, my recent interviews with children living in a group of islands that includes Tertia show that these children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village. This research of mine proves that Dr. Field's conclusion about Tertian village culture is invalid and thus that the observation-centered approach to studying cultures is invalid as well. The interview-centered method that my team of graduate students is currently using in Tertia will establish a much more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions there and in other island cultures."

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the article, Dr. Karp argues that Dr. Field’s conclusion observation method to study cultures is not sound. Also, Karp states Field’s conclusion that the entire village reared the children is invalid. However, due to the unsubstantiated assumptions throughout the argument, the argument is unconvincing.

	First, Dr. Karp assumes that Dr. Field’s observation method twenty years ago is invalid because Dr. Karp’s interview method that is currently being used is more suitable. It is plausible that both methods were the most suitable at their respective time periods. Since Dr. Karp’s study was conducted twenty years ago, it is likely that only people at that time preferred being observed. In the past, many people may have thought that the interview method was an infringement upon their privacy, whereas today people are more familiar to interview. Due to Western influence, people might have become more accustomed to meeting people and currently be more receptive to interviews.

	Another assumption is that Dr. Field’s conclusion that children were raised by an entire village is unsound since Dr. Karp’s conclusion about biological parents raising the children is valid. However, talking about biological parents cannot be equivalent to being raised by them. If parents did rear the children, there should be proof that the parents and children communicate with each other, ate meals, and slept together on a daily basis. After all, children may be talking about their biological parents because they miss their parents, not because their parents raised them. Also, it is possible that both of the conclusions are correct. Twenty years ago, children may have been reared by an entire village since families long ago consisted of not only biological parents but also grandparents and close relatives. However, nowadays, due to globalization and Western influence, parents may want to raise their children. The extended family was prevalent in the past, and currently, the nuclear family may be more ubiquitous.

	Lastly, Dr. Karp assumes that Tertia can be generalized as all islands, so the method used in Tertia and conclusions about Tertia are applicable to other islands. Since Dr. Field conducted his studies on the island of Tertia and Dr. Karp conducted his research on the group of islands that includes Tertia, the different results might be due to the difference in regions. Thus, Dr. Fields’s conclusion may be correct in dealing with one island, and Dr. Karp might be correct when comprehensively looking at the group of the islands. Also, Dr. Karp’s graduate students may lack the skills that experts, such as Dr. Field, have. Therefore, more concrete evidence from credible sources would be vital for Dr. Karp to discard Dr. Field’s conclusion.

	In brief, Dr. Karp makes an invalid argument that Dr. Field’s observation method and conclusion are incorrect. In order to bolster the argument, Dr. Karp needs to provide validity of the research methods by considering the difference of twenty years and the difference of Tertia and other islands.

A recently issued twenty-year study on headaches suffered by the residents of Mentia investigated the possible therapeutic effect of consuming salicylates. Salicylates are members of the same chemical family as aspirin, a medicine used to treat headaches. Although many foods are naturally rich in salicylates, food-processing companies also add salicylates to foods as preservatives. The twenty-year study found a correlation between the rise in the commercial use of salicylates and a steady decline in the average number of headaches reported by study participants. At the time when the study concluded, food-processing companies had just discovered that salicylates can also be used as flavor additives for foods, and, as a result, many companies plan to do so. Based on these study results, some health experts predict that residents of Mentia will suffer even fewer headaches in the future.
 
The following appeared as a recommendation by a committee planning a ten-year budget for the city of Calatrava.

"The birthrate in our city is declining: in fact, last year's birthrate was only one-half that of five years ago. Thus the number of students enrolled in our public schools will soon decrease dramatically, and we can safely reduce the funds budgeted for education during the next decade. At the same time, we can reduce funding for athletic playing fields and other recreational facilities. As a result, we will have sufficient money to fund city facilities and programs used  primarily by adults, since we can expect the adult population of the city to increase."

[essay_ann]

	In this recommendation, the committee claims that money to fund city facilities and programs used by adults will be available due to the expected increase in the adult population. He proves this by revealing the decrease in the number of students at public schools and reduction in funding for athletic playing fields and other recreational buildings. At first glance, this argument may seem convincing; however, the lack of evidence leads me to question its validity.

	First, the committee needs to add more solid evidence on the innate conditions of last year and the next decade to prove that the number of students in public schools will decrease. It is entirely possible that the decline in birth rate last year was an aberration. Last year’s decline may be temporary and cannot be generalized as that of the next decade. In fact, reducing educational funds during the next decade may be a far-fetched idea. Also, the committee explicitly states that the number of students enrolled in public schools would decrease. However, it is plausible that the students who enrolled in private schools, not public schools, may decrease.

	Second, more concrete evidence is needed on the correlation between decline in educational funds and reduction in funds towards athletic playing fields and other recreational facilities. There is no evidence provided on why decreased educational funds should yield a reduction in recreational activities. Since athletic playing fields and recreational facilities could be used by not only students but also adults, related funds should not be reduced. There could be a decrease in other areas, such as performing arts and number of staff members.

	Moreover, the committee needs to provide more specific evidence on the soundness of the conclusion that an expected increase in the adult population should lead to funding of facilities and programs used by adults. Since the committee expects the adult population to increase, such an increase may not actually happen. At best, there could be no change in the adult population. At worst, in the future, the adult population could decrease. In addition, if the adult population increases, it does not indicate that there should be sufficient funds for facilities and programs used by adults. These funds could, after all, be used for other purposes, such as programs dealing with children.

	In brief, the committee’s argument on the availability of funds for city facilities and programs used by adults is unconvincing. To strengthen the argument, the committee needs to add more statistical data on the conditions of the past, present, and future; indicate a correlation between reduction in educational funds and decline in athletic funds; and prove the soundness of the conclusion.
 
The following appeared in a letter to the editor of Parson City's local newspaper.

 "In our region of Trillura, the majority of money spent on the schools that most students attend—the city-run public schools—comes from taxes that each city government collects. The region's cities differ, however, in the budgetary priority they give to public education. For example, both as a proportion of its overall tax revenues and in absolute terms, Parson City has recently spent almost twice as much per year as Blue City has for its public schools—even though both cities have about the same number of residents. Clearly, Parson City residents place a higher value on providing a good education in public schools than Blue City residents do."

The following appeared in a memorandum from the planning department of an electric power company.

"Several recent surveys indicate that homeowners are increasingly eager to conserve energy. At the same time, manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, that are almost twice as energy efficient as those sold a decade ago. Also, new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to reduce the energy needed for home heating. Therefore, the total demand for electricity in our area will not increase—and may decline slightly. Since our three electric generating plants in operation for the past twenty years have always met our needs, construction of new generating plants will not be necessary."

 "In an effort to improve our employees' productivity, we should implement electronic monitoring of employees' Internet use from their workstations. Employees who use the Internet from their workstations need to be identified and punished if we are to reduce the number of work hours spent on personal or recreational activities, such as shopping or playing games.

The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment complex to its manager.

"One month ago, all showerheads in the first three buildings of the Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. I predict that modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically."

"An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where fish consumption is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds. Since colds represent the most frequently given reason for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of Ichthaid—a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil—as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism."

The following appeared in a recommendation from the planning department of the city of Transopolis.

 "Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the entire city increased. To further revitalize the city, we should now take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city. Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action will be readily available."

[essay_ann]

	In this recommendation, the planning department states that the city of Transpolis should adapt for industrial use in an area of severely substandard housing on the opposite side of the city. Even though this argument may seem sound at first, the lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of the urban renewal program leads me to doubt the validity of the argument.

	First, the department should provide solid evidence that crime rates declined and property tax revenues increased due to the adoption of a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway. It is possible that crime rates in the area decreased not due to the creation of factories, but due to the increase in the number of policemen and regulations. The stricter environment may have caused people to hesitate in committing crimes, and the police officers stopped people from committing as many crimes as before. Also the department adamantly believes that the increase in property tax revenues from the entire city is advantageous. However, if the revenues increased a negligible amount, it may be a substantial increase. The urban renewal program should not be seen as very effective.

	Second, the department needs to supplement the argument with concrete evidence that alternative housing will be readily available to displaced residents since some houses and apartments in nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied. It is likely that the unoccupied housing is not sufficient enough to accommodate all those who are displaced. Only some houses are unoccupied, so these empty spaces may not be adequate for all the displaced residents. Even if there is more than enough alternate housing for the displaced people, it is plausible that people, it is plausible that people in the declining residential area may not want to give up their current housing and may be dissatisfied with alternate housing. If displaced people are not satisfied with the housing, the urban renewal program may still cause problems.

	Lastly, more specific evidence is needed on the soundness of the conclusion that Transpolis should take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city to further revitalize the city. It must be noted that factories may have yielded benefits ten years ago, but now there may be a surplus of factories because many factories were created within the decade. Thus, creating more factories would not be indispensable. In addition, the circumstances of the area near the freeway might be different from the opposite side of the city. If the declining area on the opposite side of the city is not near the freeway, factories might not benefit from the convenient location. In such a case, the housing should not be adapted for industrial use.

	In summary, the department’s argument is unconvincing. To bolster the argument, the department needs to give more detailed information on the inherent conditions of ten years ago versus the present and reconsider other possibilities for the declining crime rates and increasing tax revenues.

In this recommendation, the author argues that the city should industrialize substandard housing near the freeway. He attempts to convince his readers by asserting that an urban renewal program of the city of Transopolis revitalized its city by reducing crime rates, increasing property tax revenue, and constructing several factories. The argument may seem convincing; however, the lack of evidence leads me to question the validity of the argument

First, the author needs to provide solid evidence that the urban renewal program by the city of Transpolis was actually beneficial to the city. He notes that several factories were constructed, crime rates declined, tax revenues increased. However, it might be the case that the city builds factories every year, and the change in crime rates and tax revenues was negligible. Also, a number of factories built, crime rates, and tax rates cannot be generalized as the city’s performance. For example, the urban renewal program had a negative effect on the city’s atmosphere which is harmful to a city in the long term. Therefore, the author should perform a more comprehensive analysis of the city’s change instead of focusing on only a few factors.

Secondly, concrete evidence is needed that a similar action on the opposite side of the city will result in the same results. It is possible that the economic situation was aberrational ten years ago or people worked harder in general. Then, even if a similar project has been implemented, it would be irrational to expect similar results. On top of that, the innate conditions of the opposite side of the city might be different. To be specific, if only a few people live in those houses and a majority of the residents are elderly, it would be unsound to proceed with the project; old people might prefer the current substandard housing to industrialized housing. Thus, the author must take the difference of time and area into consideration.

Lastly, the author must consider the feasibility of expanding the project. It could be plausible that the expenses in industrializing a large area are not profitable anymore. The author must take into consideration the increased daily wages of workers or change in construction techniques which requires a higher cost. Furthermore, it is plausible that people’s preference for the living condition has been altered. These days, people tend to live in country houses rather than apartments. Hence, a change in economic conditions or people’s preference should not be neglected. (Topic did not mention profit)

The argument is flawed in many aspects. To strengthen it, he needs to identify the pros and cons of the renewal program. The author also needs to provide more evidence on the feasibility of the urban renewal project, by providing an estimated costs and expected outcomes.

The following appeared in a memo from the new vice president of Sartorian, a company that manufactures men's clothing.

"Five years ago, at a time when we had difficulties in obtaining reliable supplies of high-quality wool fabric, we discontinued production of our alpaca overcoat. Now that we have a new fabric supplier, we should resume production. This coat should sell very well: since we have not offered an alpaca overcoat for five years and since our major competitor no longer makes an alpaca overcoat, there will be pent-up customer demand. Also, since the price of most types of clothing has increased in each of the past five years, customers should be willing to pay significantly higher prices for alpaca overcoats than they did five years ago, and our company profits will increase."

A recent sales study indicates that consumption of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants has increased by 30 percent during the past five years. Yet there are no currently operating city restaurants whose specialty is seafood. Moreover, the majority of families in Bay City are two-income families, and a nationwide study has shown that such families eat significantly fewer home-cooked meals than they did a decade ago but at the same time express more concern about healthy eating. Therefore, the new Captain Seafood restaurant that specializes in seafood should be quite popular and profitable.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the argument, the author argues that the new Captain Seafood restaurant specializing in seafood would actually be quite popular and profitable. He mentions a current lack of seafood specialty restaurants and results from two studies to prove his point. However, due to the lack of evidence throughout the argument, the argument is unconvincing.

	To begin with, the author needs to add solid evidence on the initial number of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants and the current lack of seafood specialty restaurants. He adamantly believes that a 30% increase is substantial. However, the initial number of seafood dishes may be minute. A 30% increase may not be significant, so seafood dishes are actually not very popular as the author thinks. Also, the author believes that it is a pressing problem that there are no currently operating seafood city restaurants despite the increasing popularity of seafood. However, existing restaurants might have added seafood to their menu due to the rise in seafood popularity. Thus, there would be no need to create new seafood specialized restaurants.

	Moreover, evidence is needed on the soundness of the nationwide study to prove that families will eat healthy foods like seafood. It is possible that eating seafood dishes is not equivalent to eating healthily. People could be eating more fruits and vegetables or cutting down on foods with a lot of calories or fat instead of eating seafood. In addition, a concern may simply be a thought in people’s mind and cannot be the same as actual action. In this case, the people may not actually change their eating habits despite their worries about eating healthily.

	Lastly, the author needs to provide more specific evidence that the new Captain seafood restaurant will be popular and profitable due to increasing popularity in seafood. It is plausible that, given the study that reveals that seafood dishes are popular, other restaurants may respond by offering these dishes as well. In this case, with the rising competition of other rivals, the new Captain Seafood restaurant may not actually be popular. Even if the seafood restaurant was popular, it might not be lucrative. After all, profit is dependent on not only revenue but also expenses. With specific evidence on the rent for the restaurant, salary given to employees, and exorbitant costs of seafood, the author should note that expenses would increase. Then, the conclusion that the seafood restaurant would profit could be weakened.

	In brief, the author’s argument on the popularity and profit of the new seafood restaurant is not persuasive. In order to bolster the argument, the author needs to prove the credibility of the results of the two studies and provide a budget for a typical seafood restaurant.

Milk and dairy products are rich in vitamin D and calcium—substances essential for building and maintaining bones. 

Many people therefore say that a diet rich in dairy products can help prevent osteoporosis, a disease that is linked to both environmental and genetic factors and that causes the bones to weaken significantly with age. 
But a long-term study of a large number of people found that those who consistently consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study. 
Since bone fractures are symptomatic of osteoporosis, this study result shows that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase, rather than decrease, the risk of osteoporosis.

[Brainstorm]
[CR] genetic factor > dairy products 
[CR] people who consume dairy are elderly / live in adverse conditions / have weak bones
[S] higher rate => negligible
[G] bone fracture is one of the symptoms of osteoporosis / dairy might be bad for only bone fracture
________________________________________________________________________________________

[essay_ann]

In the argument, the author states that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase the risk of osteoporosis because bone fractures are one symptom of osteoporosis. He compares those who consumed dairy products with those who did not and provides results from a long term study to prove his point. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of evidence leads me to question the validity of the argument.

First, the author needs to provide solid evidence that there is a causal relationship between the consumption of dairy products and the higher rate of bone fractures. Those who have consistently consumed dairy products may have been unhealthy from the beginning. In fact, since osteoporosis is linked to genetic factors, they may have had a family history of osteoporosis. In addition, in all likelihood, those who consumed dairy products lived in an adverse environmental setting or had been the elderly. Because environment and age play a crucial role, such factors may have yielded a high rate of such a disease. Then, consuming dairy products should not be seen as a significant factor that led to a higher rate of bone fractures.

Moreover, more concrete information is needed on the credibility of the study results that the consumption of dairy products takes a toll on people’s health. It is possible that people who have weak bones consume dairy products because they are more susceptible to osteoporosis. In other words, the causal relationship between dairy products and a higher rate of bone fractures may actually be an inverse relation. Also, having a higher rate of bone fractures may not be a pressing issue if the difference is negligible. Thus, the author should not hastily deduce that dairy products are deleterious.

Lastly, more specific evidence is needed to determine the soundness of the conclusion that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase the risk of osteoporosis. Experiencing bone fractures cannot be equivalent to having osteoporosis. Since bone fractures are one of the symptoms of osteoporosis, consuming dairy products may contribute to a higher rate of bone fractures, not a higher rate of osteoporosis. At worst, a diet rich in dairy products may maintain the risk of osteoporosis. At best,  higher consumption of dairy products may decrease the risk. However, stating that more dairy products would increase the risk of osteoporosis is far-fetched, given the fact that such products contain substances that are indispensable to maintain bones.

In brief, the author's argument on the ineffective diet of dairy products is not persuasive. In order to bolster the argument, the author should add the aforementioned evidence.

The following appeared in a memorandum written by the chairperson of the West Egg Town Council.
"Two years ago, consultants predicted that West Egg's landfill, which is used for garbage disposal, would be completely filled within five years. During the past two years, however, the town's residents have been recycling twice as much material as they did in previous years. Next month the amount of recycled material—which includes paper, plastic, and metal—should further increase, since charges for pickup of other household garbage will double. Furthermore, over 90 percent of the respondents to a recent survey said that they would do more recycling in the future. Because of our town's strong commitment to recycling, the available space in our landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted."
_______________________________________________________________________________________

In this memorandum, the chairperson argues that the available space in the landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted because of the residents’ strong commitment to recycling. This is because recycling has increased significantly, charges for pickup of household garbage will double, and survey respondents said they would do more recycling in the future. At first glance, this argument may seem convincing; however, the lack of evidence leads me to question its validity.

	First, the chairperson needs to add more solid evidence on the initial amount of items recycled to determine whether the citizen’s commitment to recycling is sound. It is entirely possible that the initial amount of recycled items was negligible. Therefore, twice the amount would not be a substantial increase in recycling. In addition, the population of West Egg may have increased during the two years, which would yield a natural increase in garbage. It is only logical that recycled items would also increase, so an increase in recycling does not necessarily indicate that people throw away less garbage.

	Second, more concrete evidence is needed on the causal relationship between the double charge for garbage pickup and the increase in the amount of material recycled. The double charge would not necessarily impede people from throwing away trash. If the initial cost was marginal, double might not be substantial. Thus, the increased charge may not stop citizens from accumulating garbage. Even if the double charge is substantial, it does not guarantee that people would recycle. Instead, people may pay the flat rate for garbage pickup and throw away more trash since they are dissatisfied with the higher price. Unless people are charged more for the larger garbage amount, the residents would have no incentive to increase the amount they recycle.

Moreover, the chairperson needs to provide specific statistical data on the survey results to prove people’s strong commitment to recycling and filling landfill space. If the number of respondents was minute, 90% may not be substantial. The survey results and the responses may not be credible, and many people may not actually recycle. Even if the results were reliable, the respondents' statements that they would recycle in the future do not indicate that they would actually carry out their promise. Their statements cannot be taken at face value. People may not recycle, and space in the landfill should be completely filled within five years.

	In brief, the chairperson’s memorandum on the town’s strong commitment to recycling is unconvincing. To strengthen it, he needs to identify the relationship between an increase in recycling and a decrease in trash. He also needs to prove the relationship between the double change for pickup of household garbage and an increase in recycling.

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a journal on environmental issues.

"Over the past year, the Crust Copper Company (CCC) has purchased over 10,000 square miles of land in the tropical nation of West Fredonia. Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in pollution and, since West Fredonia is the home of several endangered animal species, in environmental disaster. But such disasters can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with CCC's copper unless the company abandons its mining plans."

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

[Brainstorm]
[IC] 10,000 is not for mining
[IC] CCC takes preventive measures to prevent endangered animal species.
[IC] endangered don’t live in the area
[IC] Refusing purchase CCC would not help => other company will continue
[IC] Long term issue => stop buying won’t help
________________________________________________________________________________________

	In the argument, the author argues that consumers should refuse to purchase products that are made with Crust Copper Company’s copper or the company should abandon its mining plans. He attempts to convince his readers by asserting that CCC purchased land in West Fredonia to mine copper. He further contends that mining copper will lead to pollution and environmental disaster. At first, the argument seems persuasive. However, the stated and unstated assumptions lead me to question its validity.

	First, the author assumes that Crust Copper Company purchased 10,000 square miles of land last year to mine copper. However, it is possible that the company bought the land for other purposes. In particular, CCC may have decided to clear the forests for cattle grazing or to expand its businesses by building roads, homes or other tourist attractions. Since CCC bought the land last year, the results of how the land is used should be viewed in the long run. Even if the company purchased the land to mine copper, 10,000 square miles of land in West Fredonia may not be substantial compared to all of West Fredonia. In such a case, mining copper would not have a significantly adverse impact on the nation of West Fredonia, so it should not be considered a pressing issue.

	Another assumption the author makes is that mining copper would yield pollution and environmental disaster and harm several endangered animal species. However, it must be emphasized that mining copper may not yield a significant amount of pollution because of the state-of-the-art technology that can mitigate the detrimental effects of the mining programs and the pollutants. Even though Crust Copper Company mines copper in the tropical nation of West Fredonia, it might not adversely affect the land where the endangered animal species are located. This is because the land that CCC mines might be far away from where the species reside. Not even one engendered species may be affected, so environmental disaster might not result.

	Lastly, the author makes a false assumption that consumers should refuse to purchase products that are made with Crust Copper Company’s copper if the company does not abandon its mining plans to hamper environmental disaster. Although consumers refuse to purchase products made with CCC’s copper, it is plausible that they can buy products that have copper from other companies. These other competitive companies may mine more copper, so refusing only CCC’s copper would not necessarily solve the problem and prevent disasters from occurring. In addition, if the copper business is lucrative, CCC may continue with its mining plans. Considering the profit that can be made by the programs, the company might not abandon its mining plans.

	In brief, the author’s argument is unpersuasive. In order to bolster the argument, the author should rethink the aforementioned assumptions he made.

The following appeared in a health magazine published in Corpora.
 
 "Medical experts say that only one-quarter of Corpora's citizens meet the current standards for adequate physical fitness, even though twenty years ago, one-half of all of Corpora's citizens met the standards as then defined. But these experts are mistaken when they suggest that spending too much time using computers has caused a decline in fitness. Since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of Corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest, it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit. Instead, as shown by this year's unusually low expenditures on fitness-related products and services, the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause, and fitness levels will improve when the economy does."

 "Last year the number of students who enrolled in online degree programs offered by nearby Omni University increased by 50 percent. During the same year, Omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space, most likely because online instruction takes place via the Internet. In contrast, over the past three years, enrollment at Humana University has failed to grow and the cost of maintaining buildings has increased. Thus, to increase enrollment and solve the problem of budget deficits at Humana University, we should initiate and actively promote online degree programs like those at Omni."

An ancient, traditional remedy for insomnia—the scent of lavender flowers—has now been proved effective. In a recent study, 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia sleep each night for three weeks on lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was monitored electronically. During the first week, volunteers continued to take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but woke up feeling tired. At the beginning of the second week, the volunteers discontinued their sleeping medication. During that week, they slept less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. During the third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the previous two weeks. Therefore, the study proves that lavender cures insomnia within a short period of time.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the argument, the author believes that lavender cures insomnia over a short period of time. He provides a recent study conducted on 30 volunteers and results from three weeks to prove his point. This argument may seem convincing at first, but the lack of evidence leads me to question the validity of the argument.

	First, the author needs to provide solid evidence that the conditions of the study could be taken at face value to prove the effectiveness of lavender scent. The author explicitly states that the recent study was conducted on 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia. It should be noted that 30 volunteers may be a marginal number of people, and thus, it is possible that these respondents cannot be generalized as all people with chronic insomnia. Also, the duration of the study needs to be considered. The author provided the results for three weeks, but it is plausible that the fourth and fifth week results may differ. People may not have slept soundly after the third week. Results from a longer time period may be needed to validate the soundness of the results that lavender scent is effective on people’s sleep.

	Secondly, the author needs to supplement the argument with more evidence on the results that were disclosed in the third week which revealed the sound sleep of the volunteers. He strongly believes that lavender scent is helpful since volunteers slept longer and more soundly than before. Nevertheless, the respondents may have slept soundly during the third week because they were tired from the lack of sleep during the previous weeks, not because the lavender scented pillows were effective. In addition, without specific information on the tiredness of the respondents during the third week, we can assume that the volunteers slept longer and more soundly but they might have awakened feeling very tired. In such a case, it should not be deduced that lavender was completely effective.

	Lastly, more detailed evidence is needed on the credibility of the conclusion that lavender curses insomnia. Although lavender scent may be helpful, it cannot be stated that lavender itself is effective. In other words, the scent of lavender flowers cannot be generalized as lavender itself. There is another possibility that sleeping soundly is not equivalent to curing insomnia. Insomnia might be caused by other factors, such as stress and personal problems. To completely cure insomnia, other problems correlated with insomnia need to also be alleviated. This is because getting sound sleep does not indicate that insomnia is cured.

	In brief, the author’s claim on lavender as a cure for insomnia is unconvincing on many grounds. He needs to provide more detailed statistics on the study, consider other factors for people’s sound sleep, and supplement the argument with a sound conclusion.

Furthermore, there has been a fourfold increase in sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol. This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few of the most healthy citizens regularly eat."

Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands had become extinct. Yet humans cannot have been a factor in the species' extinctions, because there is no evidence that humans had any significant contact with the mammals. Further, archaeologists have discovered numerous sites where the bones of fish had been discarded, but they found no such areas containing the bones of large mammals, so the humans cannot have hunted mammals. Therefore, some climate change or other environmental factors must have caused the species' extinctions.

The following appeared in a memo from the president of Bower Builders, a company that constructs new homes.

"A nationwide survey reveals that the two most-desired home features are a large family room and a large, well- appointed kitchen. A number of homes in our area built by our competitor Domus Construction have such features and have sold much faster and at significantly higher prices than the national average. To boost sales and profits, we should increase the size of the family rooms and kitchens in all the homes we build and should make state-of-the-art kitchens a standard  feature. Moreover, our larger family rooms and kitchens can come at the expense of the dining room, since many of our recent buyers say they do not need a separate dining room for family meals."

Words action financial reason

Surveyors do not represent the company’s customers. Nationwide => narrow
Recent buyers are mostly young people 

Sold faster and higher price because good location advertisement

Expense for larger family rooms exceeds dining room.

The following recommendation appeared in a memo from the mayor of the town of Hopewell.

"Two years ago, the nearby town of Ocean View built a new municipal golf course and resort hotel. During the past two years, tourism in Ocean View has increased, new businesses have opened there, and Ocean View's tax revenues have risen by 30 percent. Therefore, the best way to improve Hopewell's economy—and generate additional tax revenues—is to build a golf course and resort hotel similar to those in Ocean View."

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the memo, the mayor argues that Hopewell should build a golf course and resort hotel similar to those in Ocean View in order to improve Hopewell’s economy. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the unwarranted assumptions lead me to question its validity.

	The first assumption the mayor makes is that a new municipal golf course and resort hotel improved Ocean View’s economy. However, it is possible that the economy improved because of the creation of a new museum or cultural site, not because of the golf course and hotel. After all, golf courses and hotels are not the only tourist attractions that can help develop the economy. It is also plausible that the convenient transportation in Ocean View allowed people to readily access the golf course and resort hotel. The opening of a new highway or airport could have fostered the boom in the economy, so the golf course and hotel may not be beneficial for the economy.

	Furthermore, the mayor assumes that the three advantages - the increase in tourism, the opening of new businesses, and the 30% increase in tax revenues - indicate Ocean View’s good economy. However, the author does not specifically state exactly how much tourism has increased. If the increase is negligible, it may not be a substantial increase compared to increased tourism in other cities and towns. Without a comparison with other locations, Ocean Views increase in tourism may not be considerable. Also, a new business is not necessarily a successful business. Without the long term results of the new businesses, they may go bankrupt. The new businesses might close down immediately. There is another possibility that the initial tax revenue is marginal, so 30% increase is not considerable. Overall, these factors might not indicate Ocean View’s improved economy.

	Lastly, the mayor falsely assumes that the inherent characteristics of Hopewell are similar to those of Ocean View. He implies that Hopewell should build a similar golf course and hotel as the best way to improve its economy. However, it is likely that the town of Hopewell might not be located near the ocean, so people would not want to golf or relax in Hopewell. Ocean View is most likely located near the ocean; thus, they would want to golf and relax at a hotel in Ocean View. Hopewell should not follow Ocean View and build a similar golf course and hotel. In addition, in all likelihood, Hopewell already has many tourist attractions, so the creation of a golf course and hotel may not be the best way to improve their economy. Providing other major tourist attractions might be a better way to improve its economy.

	In summary, the mayor’s argument on the beneficial effects of building a golf course and resort hotel is unconvincing. To strengthen the argument, the mayor needs to compare the two cities carefully and reconsider other factors that can yield economic development.

[81] [Question - Conclusion]

The following appeared in a business magazine.

"As a result of numerous complaints of dizziness and nausea on the part of consumers of Promofoods tuna, the company requested that eight million cans of its tuna be returned for testing. Promofoods concluded that the canned tuna did not, after all, pose a health risk. This conclusion is based on tests performed on samples of the recalled cans by chemists from Promofoods; the chemists found that of the eight food chemicals most commonly blamed for causing symptoms of dizziness and nausea, five were not found in any of the tested cans. The chemists did find small amounts of the three remaining suspected chemicals but pointed out that these occur naturally in all canned foods."


________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the business magazine, the author concludes that cans from Promofoods did not contain chemicals that posed a health risk. He makes this conclusion based on tests conducted by chemists from Promofoods and their findings of eight food chemicals most commonly blamed for causing dizziness and nausea. However, due to the lack of answers to specific questions throughout the argument, the conclusion is unconvincing.

	To begin with, the author needs to answer the question whether the test results are credible to determine that the canned tuna did not pose a health risk. It could be possible that the eight million cans of its tuna that were returned for testing are not reliable. This is because the requested cans can possibly be the cans that had no problems. In such a case, the tests may be biased, and the cans that received complaints should be tested. Even if the results of the tests are credible, the author cannot rashly deduce that canned tuna cans did not pose a health risk. The cans were tested solely for dizziness and nausea, dizziness and nausea cannot be generalized as all health risks. Thus, the canned tuna may have posed other health risks.

	Moreover, the author should provide answers whether the samples were accurately tested by chemists from Promofoods. Are the findings of chemists trustworthy when they tested the eight food chemicals that are most commonly blamed for causing dizziness and nausea? It is quite plausible that the chemists from Promofoods were biased and simply disclosed the results that yielded benefits to the company. They may have withheld other results that were adverse to Promofoods, so a fair sample should be tested by a third party that has no affiliation with promofoods. Also, testing only the eight most commonly blamed chemicals and excluding other chemicals may be inaccurate. In all likelihood, other food chemicals may cause dizziness and nausea, and thus, all chemicals should be tested.

	Lastly, more answers are needed on the question whether the remaining suspected chemicals are harmful because they naturally occurred in all canned foods. The author adamantly believes that the three remaining suspected chemicals cannot have an adverse impact on people because they are also naturally found in other canned foods. Instead of the three chemicals not being detrimental in all the canned foods, the three chemicals may actually be adverse in Promofoods as well as all canned foods. Just because the three remaining chemicals are found in all canned foods, it does not justify that the chemicals are not harmful.

	In summary, the author’s conclusion is not persuasive as it stands. In order to strengthen the conclusion, the author should provide answers to the above question.

[84] [alternative explanation]

The following is a letter to the editor of an environmental magazine.

"Two studies of amphibians in Xanadu National Park confirm a significant decline in the numbers of amphibians. In 1975 there were seven species of amphibians in the park, and there were abundant numbers of each species. However, in 2002 only four species of amphibians were observed in the park, and the numbers of each species were drastically reduced. One proposed explanation is that the decline was caused by the introduction of trout into the park's waters, which began in 1975. (Trout are known to eat amphibian eggs.)"

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the letter, the author concludes that the introduction of trout into the park’s waters has caused a decline in amphibians. He provides two studies of amphibians in Xanadu National Park to prove this decrease. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of explanations leads me to question the validity of the argument.

	First, the author must take into account other explanations for the results of the first and second study and the different conditions of each study to prove a decline in amphibians. It is entirely possible that the first study was conducted for one year and the second study was conducted for a week. In this case, the second study might have observed fewer amphibians not because they actually reduced, but because the researchers did not have enough time to find them due to the time restrictions and study limitations. Also, it is plausible that the first study may have been conducted by a group of experts in the field and the second study was done by a group of college students specializing in a completely different field. If this were the case, it is more likely that the experts would have found more species of amphibians because of their expertise and knowledge compared to the amateurs. In other words, the second study may not actually indicate a decrease in amphibians.

	An alternative for the decline in amphibians needs to be considered by discussing the credibility of the observation in 2002. The author states that the number of species decreased; however, it is likely that the numbers of amphibians did not actually reduce. Instead, the researchers simply may not have been able to find the amphibians. Since the argument states that the number of amphibians observed decreased, this does not indicate that they declined in actuality.

	Lastly, the author needs to take into consideration other possible explanations for the decline in the number of amphibians besides the introduction of trout. In all likelihood, the amphibians decreased not because of the introduction of the trout, but because of other factors, such as humans, an environmental factor, or lack of food. In particular, hunters could have killed the amphibians for industrial purposes. Also, the environment could have rapidly changed, so the amphibians were not able to adjust to the climate changes. In addition, other predators could have negatively affected the amphibians themselves, so the amphibian eggs were not negatively affected. Other predators, not trout, resulted in the decline of amphibians.

	In brief, the author’s claim is not persuasive on many grounds. In order to strengthen the argument, the author should provide more solid data on the two studies and reconsider other possibilities that could have yielded the decline in amphibians.

"When XYZ lays off employees, it pays Delany Personnel Firm to offer those employees assistance in creating re ́ sume ́ s and developing interviewing skills, if they so desire. Laid-off employees have benefited greatly from Delany's services: last year those who used Delany found jobs much more quickly than did those who did not. Recently, it has been proposed that we use the less expensive Walsh Personnel Firm in place of Delany. This would be a mistake because eight years ago, when XYZ was using Walsh, only half of the workers we laid off at that time found jobs within a year. Moreover, Delany is clearly superior, as evidenced by its bigger staff and larger number of branch offices. After all, last year Delany's clients took an average of six months to find jobs, whereas Walsh's clients took nine."

[essay_ann]
	In the memo, the XYZ company argues that it should not use less expensive Walsh in place of Delany due to the benefits of Delany’s services and drawbacks of Walsh’s services. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of evidence leads me to question the validity of the argument.

	First, the company needs to provide evidence on Delany’s clients and their abilities to prove the usefulness of Delany’s services. The company adamantly believes that Delany yielded benefits to their clients since they were able to readily obtain jobs. However, it is possible that the good services last year were temporary, and Delany’s good services last year were temporary, and Delany’s good performance will not continue in the future. In particular, the majority of jobs found last year may have been part-time or low salary jobs. If clients are not satisfied with their jobs, finding jobs quickly may not be crucial. Also, without information on the qualifications of the people who used Delany, it is plausible that the clients who used Delany’s services were extremely qualified and naturally eager to find jobs. In this case, clients found jobs quickly because of their innate talent, not because of Delany’s good services. 

	Second, the company needs to supplement the argument with more concrete evidence on the innate conditions eight years ago and the present to demonstrate Walsh’ inferiority. It is likely that eight years ago the economic conditions were adverse, and therefore, many clients who used Walsh were not able to acquire jobs as quickly. Then, Walsh Personnel Firm should not be seen as inferior. In addition, the XYZ company does not recommend less expensive Walsh due to the aforementioned drawbacks of Walsh’s services. Even if Delany is better in terms of services, the difference of quality may be minute, but the difference of costs might be substantial. Thus, people may prefer Walsh over Delany. If low costs override good quality services, the proposal to use Walsh may not be a mistake.

	Lastly, more specific evidence is needed on the quality of the staff and branch offices of Delany to prove its superiority. Although Delany has a bigger staff, it is possible that a majority of the staff members are amateurs. In other words, the quantity of workers cannot always indicate their qualifications. Furthermore, a larger number of branch offices may be prevalent, but without providing evidence of its quality, there is a high chance that they do not offer amicable services. This would indicate that Delany might not offer good services, so Delany may not be superior.

	In brief, XYZ company’s argument is unconvincing. To bolster the argument, it should make a valid comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of Delany and Walsh.

______________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_sean]
In this memorandum, the author argues that XYZ company should not replace Delany Personnel Firm with Walsh Personnel Firm. To support this claim, he mentions that Delany usually finds jobs more quickly than Walsh and it has a bigger staff and larger number of branch offices. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of evidence leads me to doubt the validity of the argument.

First, the author believes that last year, those who used Delany found jobs much more quickly than those who did not because they benefited from Delany’s good services. However, it might be possible that the difference is negligible. It can be assumed that people who used Delany’s services were more eager to find new jobs than those who did not. Also, it could be plausible that people using Delany’s services were satisfied with part-time or low-salary positions, so they could find jobs quickly. In other words, finding jobs quickly cannot be generalized as Delany’s skill. Hence, the author needs to provide more specific evidence that Delany’s services help people to find high-quality, suitable jobs quickly. 

Second, the author hastily assumed that because of Walsh Company’s incompetence, only half of the workers they laid off eight years ago got jobs. It is entirely possible that people in general were not competent and the job market was not favorable for them. In a tight labor market, even skilled people find difficulty to get a job. On top of that, it might be the case that XYZ company was not famous eight years ago. Most companies tend to hire people from renowned companies. Therefore, it can be assumed that many people could not get a job because of their inexperience and inability not because of Walsh Company’s incompetence.

Lastly, the author believes that Delany is clearly superior because of its bigger staff and larger number of branch offices. However, the number of members and branch offices cannot be generalized as a company’s ability. For example, one of the top automobile companies, Tesla, does not have any management stores. In fact, fewer experienced people and offices often yield better outcomes. To sum up, more concrete evidence is needed that Delany not only has more people and offices but also they are more skilled and proficient than Walsh. (need to specifically refer to Delany & Walsh)

In brief, the author’s claim that XYZ company should adhere to Delany is flawed and illogical. To strengthen it, the author must provide concrete evidence on the quality of jobs taken by employees who used Delany. The author should also take other factors into consideration, such as the people’s proficiency and overall trends in the job market.

[87] [Assumption]

 In a study of the reading habits of Waymarsh citizens conducted by the University of Waymarsh, most respondents said they preferred literary classics as reading material. However, a second study conducted by the same researchers found that the type of book most frequently checked out of each of the public libraries in Waymarsh was the mystery novel. Therefore, it can be concluded that the respondents in the first study had misrepresented their reading preferences.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the argument, the author states that respondents in the first study had misrepresented their reading preferences due to the differences in the two studies. He reveals that people preferred literary classics in the first study results, and people checked out mystery novels most frequently in the second study. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the unwarranted assumptions lead me to question its validity.

	First, the author assumes that the respondents of the first study are the same respondents to the second study. Thus, he implies that both studies could be compared equally. It is stated in the argument that the second study was conducted by the same researchers. However, it is entirely possible that it was not conducted on the same respondents. If the respondents in the first study were not the same book borrowers in the second study, it would be illogical to compare the two studies. The respondents in the first study preferred literary classics, and the second study respondents were different people, so they actually preferred the mystery novel. If this is the case, respondents of both studies are correct.

	Another assumption the author makes is that the results of the second study are sound. He thus implies that people who frequently check out mystery novels actually prefer the mystery novel. Even if the respondents of the first and second studies were the same people, checking out mystery novels cannot be equivalent to preferring such books. It is plausible that people checked out these books in the second study because it was a mandatory homework assignment. They were coerced to check out books and they did not actually prefer the books. Also, in all likelihood, people may have more frequently checked out literary classics from private or school libraries or purchased these books from bookstores. Hence, rentals from other libraries and sales from bookstores should also be considered before asserting that people prefer mystery novels.

	Lastly, the author assumes that the first study respondents misrepresented their reading habits because their responses are different from the second study respondents. He implies that the results of one study are wrong. However, it is likely that the results of both studies are accurate. In the first study, the respondents preferred literary classics. The second study respondents may have become more interested in mystery novels due to the highly-acclaimed mystery novel that was published in between the first and second study. Thus a shift in the reading habits and preferences is possible, and the first group did not misrepresent their reading habits.

	In brief, the author’s argument on the reading preferences of Waymarsh residents is unconvincing on many grounds. To strengthen the argument, the author needs to rethink the aforementioned assumptions that he made.

The following appeared in a memo at XYZ company.

"When XYZ lays off employees, it pays Delany Personnel Firm to offer those employees assistance in creating re ́ sume ́ s and developing interviewing skills, if they so desire. Laid-off employees have benefited greatly from Delany's services: last year those who used Delany found jobs much more quickly than did those who did not. Recently, it has been proposed that we use the less expensive Walsh Personnel Firm in place of Delany. This would be a mistake because eight years ago, when XYZ was using Walsh, only half of the workers we laid off at that time found jobs within a year. Moreover, Delany is clearly superior, as evidenced by its bigger staff and larger number of branch offices. After all, last year Delany's clients took an average of six months to find jobs, whereas Walsh's clients took nine."

Three years ago, because of flooding at the Western Palean Wildlife Preserve, 100 lions and 100 western gazelles were moved to the East Palean Preserve, an area that is home to most of the same species that are found in the western preserve, though in larger numbers, and to the eastern gazelle, a close relative of the western gazelle. The only difference in climate is that the eastern preserve typically has slightly less rainfall. Unfortunately, after three years in the eastern preserve, the imported western gazelle population has been virtually eliminated. Since the slight reduction in rainfall cannot be the cause of the virtual elimination of western gazelle, their disappearance must have been caused by the larger number of predators in the eastern preserve.

The following appeared in a memo from the Board of Directors of Butler Manufacturing.

"During the past year, workers at Butler Manufacturing reported 30 percent more on-the-job accidents than workers at nearby Panoply Industries, where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours. A recent government study reports that fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers are significant contributing factors in many on-the-job accidents. Therefore, we recommend that Butler Manufacturing shorten each of its work shifts by one hour. Shorter shifts will allow Butler to improve its safety record by ensuring that its employees are adequately rested."

[essay_ann]

	In this memorandum, the vice president of Butler Manufacturing contends that Butler Manufacturing should shorten each of their work shifts by one hour to improve their safety record. He makes this recommendation based on study results conducted on a selected number of participants by researchers. At first, the recommendation seems persuasive. However, the lack of answers to the following questions lead me to doubt its validity.

	First, the author needs to answer the question whether the extended work hours are the main factors of their high accidents. In the recommendation, the author only compares the percentage of accidents of both industries, without providing any further details about the nature of production, work force, and the amount of automation used in these two companies. Do both companies produce similar products using the same technology and possess identical work force and work environment? Is the data comparison still relevant, if Panoply has more automation, while Butler concentrates on manual operation? In this case, it would follow logically that Butler has more accidents as more human dexterity is involved. Thus, providing a study on similarities between the two companies would support the recommendation.

	Another question the author needs to answer is whether the degree of accidents are similar in two industries. It might be the case that most of the accidents in Butler Manufacturing are minor injuries compared to Panoply Industry. On top of that, it is possible that accident reports are helpful in seeking financial advantage and can trigger more reported injuries. For example, there might be some extra benefits at Butler Manufacturing if someone is injured, such as getting paid leave or early retirement contrary to no such benefits at Panoply. If the author could show the similarities in these issues as well, the case would possess strong veracity.

	Lastly, the author should ask whether reduced work hours will yield employees to rest more. There is a possibility that workers use the reduced work hours for other part time jobs in order to compensate for reduced pay followed by reduced work hours. Having assumed this, if the passage could answer whether the pay would be the same or reduced proportionately, it would help to support the recommendation. To strengthen the logic, a survey among the workers of Butler about how they would use one extra hour, would help a recommendation would be more logical.

	In brief, the author’s recommendation on the effectiveness of reducing work hours is unpersuasive. In order to bolster the argument, the author should provide the following questions mentioned above.

  The following appeared in a memo from the business manager of a chain of cheese stores located throughout the United States.

"For many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of both domestic and imported cheeses. Last year, however, all of the five best-selling cheeses at our newest store were domestic cheddar cheese from Wisconsin. Furthermore, a recent survey by Cheeses of the World magazine indicates an increasing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers. Since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory, the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses."

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the memo, the owner argues that the company should discontinue stocking varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses in order to profit. He proves his point by providing the five best selling cheeses at their newest store and results from a recent survey conducted on magazine subscribers. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the lack of evidence leads me to question the validity of the argument.

	First, the owner needs to provide solid evidence on the factors for the sales of the five best-selling cheeses last year. The owner explicitly states that people are in favor of domestic cheeses because domestic  cheddar cheeses were the best-selling cheese at their newest store. However, it is possible that the cheese sold well not because it was domestic cheese, but because it was cheddar cheese or it tasted good. The domestic origin of the cheeses was not crucial, and the type and taste of the cheese might have led to the high cheese sales. Even if people preferred domestic cheese, it is plausible that such a trend was prevalent only last year. Last year’s high sales might be temporary and people may not prefer domestic cheese next year and the following years.

	Second, the owner needs to supplement the argument with more concrete evidence on the validity of the recent survey conducted on magazine subscribers. He adamantly believes that an increasing preference for domestic cheeses indicates purchase of such cheeses. Although people may prefer domestic cheeses, such preference cannot be equivalent to the action of buying such cheeses. After all, people may prefer domestic cheeses for its economical price, but they may decide to buy imported cheeses for its quality.

	Lastly, the owner needs to provide specific evidence on the soundness of the conclusion that reducing expenses by limiting inventory would be the best way to improve profits. Granted, limiting inventory may reduce expenses. However, the company may lose customers who prefer imported cheese, thus yielding a decline in income and eventually profit as well. To improve profit, increasing income and selling imported cheese may be better ways since the costs of imported cheese might be higher than the costs of domestic cheese. Even if reducing expenses is the best way to profit, such a solution cannot be recommended to all stores. Limiting inventory may prove effective only at the newest store; however, the success at the newest store cannot be generalized as all stores. Other stores may have customers who like imported cheese.

	In summary, the owner’s argument on discontinuing the sales of imported cheese is unsound. To strengthen it, the owner should reconsider other factors for the high sales of domestic cheeses and other methods to profit.

[essay_sean]

	The author assumes that the best way to improve profits of his cheese stores is to discontinue stocking imported cheese. He states that a majority of customers prefer domestic cheeses to imported cheeses and limiting inventory can reduce expenses. However, the author makes hasty assumptions without valid grounds on the customers’ preferences, and the benefit of reducing inventory.

	First, the author makes an incorrect assumption that domestic cheeses are more popular than imported cheeses. He mentions that the five best-selling cheeses at the newest store were domestic cheddar cheeses from Wisconsin. However, it can be possible that only cheese from Wisconsin is famous and other popular cheeses are imported cheeses. Wisconsin cheeses cannot be generalized as all domestic cheeses. On top of that it is feasible that last year, people purchased more domestic cheeses than any other years. In order to validate his points, he should present more detailed data on the customer’s preferences over long-periods. (need to clearly explain how last year’s results were an aberration => cheddar cheese / quality)

	Second, the author mentions that a recent survey in Cheeses of the World magazine points out that their subscribers began to like domestic cheeses over imported cheeses. However, the author incorrectly assumes that the subscribers represent their store’s customers. By looking at the magazine’s name, it can be assumed that subscribers are from all over the world. Thus, the author should focus on the preference of Americans who actually buy their cheeses. Also, the survey indicates that there has been an increase in domestic cheeses preference. In other words, if domestic cheeses were unpopular, the change might be negligible. 

	Lastly, the author assumes that removing imported cheeses is the best way for the store to save a lot of money. However, it can be possible that there are better ways to increase their profits; remodeling their stores, adding other menus, or advertising can actually be more efficient ways to increase their income. Moreover, if the money spent on saving imported cheese is minute compared to other fees; such as the raw price of cheese, wages for their employees, and other transportation costs, it would be reasonable to save money from other expenses. Therefore, even if removing imported cheeses is profitable, the author cannot assume that it’s the best way.

	In conclusion, the author’s assumption that removing imported cheeses from their menus clearly lacks valid grounds. To support his argument, he needs to clearly identify the customers' preferences and other feasible ways to increase their profits.

[142] [Assumption]

Hospital statistics regarding people who go to the emergency room after roller-skating accidents indicate the need for more protective equipment. Within that group of people, 75 percent of those who had accidents in streets or parking lots had not been wearing any protective clothing (helmets, knee pads, etc.) or any light-reflecting material (clip-on lights, glow-in-the-dark wrist pads, etc.). Clearly, the statistics indicate that by investing in high-quality protective gear and reflective equipment, roller skaters will greatly reduce their risk of being severely injured in an accident.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	The author argues that investing in protective gear and reflective equipment would help roller skaters reduce the risk of being injured in accidents. He provides hospital statistics and a causal relationship between a lack of protection and accidents to prove his point. Although this argument may seem convincing at first, the unstated assumptions lead me to question its validity.

	First, the author assumes that the visits to the emergency room indicate injuries and the need for protective equipment. He implies that many people go to the emergency room after roller skating accidents because they were not wearing any protective gear. However, it is possible that these people were overly cautious and paranoid so they went to the emergency room, although they were not injured. Also, the general doctor’s offices might have been closed, so people who were not severely injured may have paid a visit to the emergency room. Going to the emergency room cannot be equivalent to being severely injured, so protective equipment may not be needed.

	Another assumption the author makes is that the lack of protective equipment and light-reflecting material yielded accidents in streets and parking lots. Nevertheless, it is plausible that the high rate of accidents occurred not because of the lack of protective equipment, but because of the dangerous locations. After all, streets and parking lots are inherently more dangerous than other places. The high rate of accidents would probably not occur if people skated in safe areas, such as parks or residential areas. In addition, it is likely that the initial number of roller skaters was negligible. In this case, 7% of those who had accidents may not be a substantial number of people, and accidents might not be a considerable problem.

	Lastly, the author assumes that investment in high-quality protective gear and reflective equipment would help reduce the risk of roller skaters being severely injured in an accident. High-quality protective gear may be a waste of money for those who are strapped for cash. Instead, a simple white t-shirt may have the same preventative measures as reflective equipment. Also, the role of the roller skater as well as the role of the drivers should be considered. Light-reflecting material would only reap benefits if the driver is safety-conscious. Thus, other ways to reduce injuries and accidents such as safety education, should be implemented.

	In brief, the author’s argument on the effectiveness in the investment in high-quality protective gear and reflective equipment is invalid. To strengthen it, he should consider other factors for the accidents in streets and parking lots.

The following appeared in a letter from a firm providing investment advice to a client.

"Homes in the northeastern United States, where winters are typically cold, have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating. Last year that region experienced 90 days with below-average temperatures, and climate forecasters at Waymarsh University predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years. Furthermore, many new homes have been built in this region during the past year. Because these developments will certainly result in an increased demand for heating oil, we recommend investment in Consolidated Industries, one of whose major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil."

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the letter, the firm recommends investment in Consolidated Industries since demand for heating oil will increase. It provides predictions from weather forecasters to prove that cold weather will continue. The firm also states that new homes have been created last year and believes that these new homes will use heating oil. However, due to the lack of answers to the following questions, the recommendation is unconvincing in many respects.

	To begin with, the firm needs to answer the question whether the conditions of last year and the statements of climate forecasters are credible to prove the continuous cold weather. It could be possible that the conditions of last year may be temporary. In such circumstances, the cold weather during the three months cannot be generalized as cold weather throughout the year. If the other nine months had warm weather, heating in homes may not be necessary. In addition, predictions of climate forecasters cannot be taken at face value. Future conditions are unpredictable, and forecasters can make wrong predictions. If the cold weather does not continue, homes might not actually need to heat their homes.

	Moreover, the firm needs to answer whether the past year’s creation of new homes yields the increased demand for heating oil. It is quite plausible that people may not necessarily buy the homes even though new homes have been built. This indicates that people may not live in these new homes. Homes may be empty, and the demand for heating oil may not increase. Even if people do purchase the new homes, people may decide to use other forms of heating, such as heaters that use electricity or natural gas. Therefore, demand for heating oil may not increase with the increase of new homes.

Lastly, more answers are needed on the soundness of the recommendation that clients should invest in Consolidated Industries. Would consolidated Industries be a good investment because one of its major operations is the retail sale of home heating oil? Although one of the major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil, if the other departments of Consolidated are not successful, investing in the entire company may not reap benefits for its customers. Instead, it may be a better idea to invest in a company that specializes in home heating. Also, without stating the costs of investing in Consolidated Industries, clients can assume that costs are exorbitant. In such a case, such as a recommendation to invest in the firm should not be advised to people who are short on cash.

In summary, the firm’s recommendation on the investment of Consolidated Industries is not persuasive. In order to strengthen the recommendation, the firm should prove the reliability of the statements of weather forecasters and provide answers to the above questions.

  Benton City residents have adopted healthier lifestyles. A recent survey of city residents shows that the eating habits of city residents conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago. During those ten years, local sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol, have increased fourfold, while sales of sulia, a food rarely eaten by the healthiest residents, have declined dramatically. Because of these positive changes in the eating habits of Benton City residents, we predict that the obesity rate in the city will soon be well below the national average.

The following is a recommendation from the personnel director to the president of Acme Publishing Company.

"Many other companies have recently stated that having their employees take the Easy Read Speed-Reading Course has greatly improved productivity. One graduate of the course was able to read a 500-page report in only two hours; another graduate rose from an assistant manager to vice president of the company in under a year. Obviously, the faster you can read, the more information you can absorb in a single workday. Moreover, Easy Read would cost Acme only $500 per employee—a small price to pay when you consider the benefits. Included in this fee is a three-week seminar in Spruce City and a lifelong subscription to the Easy Read newsletter. Clearly, to improve productivity, Acme should require all of our employees to take the Easy Read course."

The following memo appeared in the newsletter of the West Meria Public Health Council.

 "An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where consumption of the plant is beneficial is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of beneficia can prevent colds. Since colds are the reason most frequently given for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia. We predict this will dramatically reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces."
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_sean]

	The author argues that the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia will dramatically reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. He reasons that regular consumption of beneficia prevents colds and colds are the most frequent reason for absences from school and work. However, several questions need to be answered in order to decide the recommendation is likely to have a desired effect.

	First, it is questionable whether the consumption of the plant beneficia actually reduces the chance of getting a cold. For example, there might be other factors that lowered the number of cold patients in East Meria; average people in East Meria may exercise regularly, wear warm clothes, and get enough sleep at night. In that case, consumption of the plant beneficia might have negligible effects. Furthermore, it might be the case that people in East Meria do not visit doctors even if they get a cold. They might be mired in poverty and take other traditional measures to recover from a cold at home. Thus, infrequent doctor visits does not prove that they rarely get cold due to beneficia.

	Secondly, the author’s recommendation is based on the argument that the cold is the most popular reason for absences. However, he cannot conclude that preventing colds would significantly lower the number of absences. It is because people may pretend they have a cold as an excuse for absence from school and work. If so, preventing colds would not lower the rate of absences. Specifically, there might be an increase of absences from other reasons. People can pretend that they have family events or important tests. Therefore, cold might not be the main reason for the frequent absences.

	Lastly, recommending the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia may not be effective. Specifically, people might ignore the recommendation and not take the supplement. Also, the nutritional supplement may lack important properties of beneficia; for example, vitamin might have been destroyed in the process of making the supplement. Thus, consuming the supplements of beneficia may not be effective.

	In brief, the recommendation does not have a valid ground. In order to boost it further the author needs to reconsider the effectiveness of beneficia and remonmmending the use of nuitritional supplements,
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the newsletter, the author recommends the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia in order to reduce absenteeism in their schools and workplaces. At first, the recommendation seems persuasive; however, the lack of answers to the questions leads me to question its validity.

	First, the author needs to ask whether the study results can be taken at face value and whether the innate conditions of East Meria and West Maria are the same to prove the usefulness of the plant beneficia on the treatment of colds. The author believes that beneficia is essential since East Meria residents visited the doctor only once or twice per year to treat colds as stated in the study. However, the standard for visiting the doctor might vary among people. In actuality, people may have caught many more colds, but they decided to handle their colds at home instead of seeing the doctor. Paying a visit to the doctor less frequently cannot be equivalent to catching fewer colds. Also, it is possible that the weather in East Meria does not dramatically fluctuate throughout the day, so East Merians do not catch colds frequently. However, in West Meria, the weather may be unpredictable, thus causing people to readily catch colds.

	Next, the author should answer whether there is a causal relationship between the plant beneficia and fewer colds. In all likelihood, there may have been other factors that reduced colds. East Meria citizens may have not only consumed the plant beneficial but also taken other healthy foods or medicine at the same time. In this case, colds were prevented not solely due to the plant being beneficial, but due to these exogenous factors.

	Lastly, concrete answers are needed to determine whether the recommendation is sound. Based on the fact that colds are the most frequently given reason for absences from school and work, should West Meria use nutritional supplements derived from beneficial to lower absenteeism? They must first ask whether colds are actually the main reason for absences. Many people tend to give the excuse that they caught a cold, but in actuality, they could be absent due to other reasons, such as laziness or better plans to attend to. Thus, all frequent reasons should be taken into account, and these reasons should be solved to reduce absenteeism. In addition, the daily use of nutritional supplements derived from beneficia may not have the same salubrious effect as the actual plant beneficia. The positive aspects of beneficia cannot be equivalent to those of nutritional supplements, so West Meria should not use these supplements of beneficia.

	In summary, the author’s recommendation on the daily use of supplements derived from beneficia is not persuasive. The author should consider other factors for the prevention of colds and provide answers to the above questions.


The following appeared in a memo from the vice president of a company that builds shopping malls around the country.

The following appeared in a health newsletter.

"Nosinia is an herb that many users report to be as effective as prescription medications at fighting allergy symptoms. Researchers recently compared Nosinia to a placebo in 95 men and women with seasonal allergies to ragweed pollen. Participants in the study reported that neither Nosinia nor the placebo offered significant relief. However, for the most severe allergy symptoms, the researchers reported that Nosinia was more effective than the placebo in providing relief. Furthermore, at the end of the study, participants given Nosinia were more likely than participants given a placebo to report feeling healthier. We therefore recommend using Nosinia to help with your severe allergy symptoms.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	The author recommends using Nosinia because it will help people with their severe allergy symptoms. He makes this recommendation based on study results conducted on a selected number of participants by researchers. At first, the recommendation seems persuasive. However, the lack of answers to the following questions lead me to doubt its validity.

	First, the author needs to answer the question whether the 95 men and women with seasonal allergies can be trusted. It is likely that more men were conducted than women, and they consisted mostly of old people. This indicates that the sample was not collected randomly, so the results can be biased. Also, the participants may have had symptoms of the flu at the same time. Although the placebo was effective on allergy symptoms, they might have thought otherwise because of their flu symptoms. If they could not differentiate these symptoms, the results from the participants might not be valid.

	Another question the author needs to answer is whether the report from researchers that Nosinia was more effective than the placebo is credible. It must be emphasized that researchers are aiming to prove the usefulness of Nosinia, so they cannot be fully trusted. This is because they may distort the evidence and results. In all likelihood, one participant stated the effectiveness of Nosinia, and the researchers may exaggerate the effects on all people. In addition, the severity of allergy symptoms is not clearly stated. If the severity of symptoms was different for each participant, the results can be biased. Then, Nosinia might not actually be as effective as the researchers are claiming.

	Lastly, the author should ask whether participants given Nosinia can be equally compared with participants given a placebo to prove its health benefits. Can Nosinia be recommended to help with people's severe allergy symptoms? There is a possibility that participants given Nosinia were naturally healthier because they exercised more frequently and ate more healthy foods. These inherent differences caused them to feel healthier, so Nosinia might not have actually been effective. Feeling healthier is also different from feeling relief from severe allergy symptoms. Even though Nosinia can help participants feel healthier, it does not indicate that they would be relieved of their allergy symptoms. They may also feel relieved from their allergies to ragweed pollen, but they might not be relieved from other types of allergies. Hence, Nosinia should not be recommended to help fight allergy symptoms in general.

	In brief, the author’s recommendation on the effectiveness of Nosinia on allergy symptoms is unpersuasive. In order to bolster the argument, the author should prove the credibility of the study results and then provide answers to the questions that were mentioned above.

In summary, although the well-being of its individual citizens might be considered important, the achievements of leaders, particularly rulers and scientists, certainly indicate a great nation. In this fast-paced society, a country needs to make significant accomplishments to be praised by other countries.

In brief, although cooperation has its benefits, it is ultimately better for industry and sports leaders to be competitive.  The continuous will to compete with others fosters success. People in various leadership positions should thus embrace rivalry.

In brief, although a few discoveries and creations were accidental, it can be explicitly stated that most vital discoveries were planned. Luck would play a minor role in people’s daily lives.

# essay_ann

	In this current society, technology is advancing very quickly, and it is debatable whether cutting-edge technology is beneficial in the everyday lives of humans. I disagree with the statement because human minds are not always superior to machines. Moreover, it should be noted that machines are not only tools of human minds.

	Admittedly, human minds are superior to machines in most respects because humans are equipped with creativity. To illustrate, machines do not possess and cannot foster creative thinking skills like humans. Machines cannot think beyond the logical realm, and therefore, they do not have the ability to produce creative works. On the other hand, humans such as Vincent Van Gogh were capable of thinking differently and were to produce masterpieces that were ahead of their time. In particular, he was able to become a distinguished figure in the field of abstract art and create his magnum-opus “The Starry Night”. Thus, in many ways, the human mind can override machines.

	However, humans are not always superior since events in history have revealed that machines can surpass humans. To be more specific, in 1997, Garry Kasparovm the world’s most prominent chess player, lost to IBM’s Deep Blue. IBM programmed into the computer the millions of probabilities that could occur, and the computer calculated these possibilities very quickly. In this case, the human being played in comparison with the computer, thereby ending in the defeat of Garry Kasparov. Sometimes the computer can beat even a chess prodigy like Kasporov, which proves that machines have abilities that are on par or even higher than the most talented humans. Hence, human minds may sometimes be inferior to machines, so humans are not always superior to machines.

	Furthermore, machines should not be seen as only tools of human minds due to the extraordinary power machines possess. Machines should not be seen as simple tools of human minds because these tools may have the power to control the minds of humans. State-of-the-art machinery, such as the computer and the Internet, has emerged quickly, and people in this day and age are glued to the computer for endless hours. Heneral people spend hours on technological devices and cannot live even an hour without these devices. These machines have penetrated into every aspect of the lives of humans and omitted their whole lives. Therefore, machines cannot be seen as mere tools of humans because their influence should not be undermined.

	In summary, human minds, for the most part, are superior to machines. However, this is not always the case. This is because machines should not be seen as only tools. People should prepare for the fateful day that machines do become superior to humans because this day may come faster than expected.

The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.

People's attitudes are determined more by their immediate situation or surroundings than by society as a whole.

# essay_ann

In this society, various factors define people’s attitudes. Of these factors, personal and societal elements are important. Some people believe that the people closest to them shape who they are, while others argue that society determines their fate. I agree with the statement that immediate surroundings override the society when determining people’s attitudes. Also, close surroundings usually influence, not determine, people.

Admittedly, there are instances when society as a whole determines people and their attitudes. The power of the government is so strong that people have no choice but to follow the society. To illustrate, during World War II, those living in Germany were defined not by their immediate surroundings, but by their Nazi society. Due to the extremely strong influence of the society, all Germans were coerced to believe in nationalism, anti-communism, and the importance of the national power. During this time, Hitler and the society advocated the concept of racial hygiene and controlled everyone and their attitudes as they were forced to believe in the notion that the Aryan race was the most superior. This eventually led to the Holocause. As we can see from this compelling example, these people and their actions were determined by the society around them.

	Although society is crucial in a few cases, immediate surroundings play a more vital role in determining people. Close surroundings, such as family members, impact a person in a way that society cannot. In particular, when racial segregation was prevalent, Martin Luther King, Jr. became a prominent figure by using civil disobedience and other non-violet means. Despite the strong societal forces that embedded racial segregation in the citizens, King ceaselessly fought for civil rights by making speeches and boycotting buses. In his life, the people closest to him, including his devout parents and Mahatma Gandhi, significantly impacted him. These immediate surroundings determined his attitude as he pursued non-violent resistance when trying to overcome acts of racism. Hence, family and immediate surroundings determine the attitude.

	Moreover, it would be more accurate to state that close situations influence, not determine, people and their attitudes. For example, President Bill Clinton did not have a pleasant past. He grew up with a stepfather who was a gambler and alcoholic, and abuse was ubiquitous throughout his childhood as he witnessed his stepfather regularly abuse his mother. Despite such childhood experiences and adverse immediate surroundings, Clinton did not let his stepfather define him. The situations may have influenced him to a degree, but it certainly did not define him as he became president and made many achievements on behalf of the United States. Thus, close situations simply influence, not determine, people.

In summary, immediate surroundings, not the society, can influence people and their attitudes. Therefore, people should go the extra mile to surround themselves with positive situations and surroundings.

Claim: The surest indicator of a great nation must be the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists.
Reason: Great achievements by a nation's rulers, artists, or scientists will ensure a good life for the majority of that nation's people.

The general welfare of a nation's people is a better indication of that nation's greatness than are the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists.

Education
Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

# essay_ann

	In schools and educational institutions, having a set curriculum is important. In order to adequately teach students, teachers need proper teaching materials and organized lesson plans. In my opinion, the policy would not be effective. The same national curriculum should not be implemented before students matriculate into college.

	Many people may believe that implementing the policy and having a national curriculum would reap many benefits. If there was a national curriculum, the Department of Education would most likely designate a rigid curriculum so that students in elementary schools and high schools would learn the same concepts at the same pace. During primary and secondary education, if all teachers follow the same curriculum, students would gain the same opportunities when learning various subjects. This would be a stepping stone for them to discover what interests them so that they can prepare for their college major and career. Thus, a standardized curriculum may be vital in some aspects.

	However, by enforcing the policy and having the same national curriculum, it would most likely take a toll on teachers by impeding creativity in learning. The “No Child Left Behind” act in the United States is similar to a national curriculum. The state curriculum requires schools to meet certain standards in order to receive educational funding. Thus, schools are focusing on subjects that are tested on the standardized tests - reading, writing, and mathematics - and focusing less on other subjects like history, language, and performing arts. Students are focused to learn a fixed curriculum as teachers “teach to the test”. Similarly, a national curriculum may force teachers to limit their teachings and eventually hamper creativity and a well-rounded education. In such a case, enforcing this policy would prove ineffective.

	Moreover, the policy that students learn the same national curriculum would have an adverse impact on mostly students especially impoverished students. Implementing the same national curriculum would take a toll on the minorities or those mired in poverty since they would not have the money and resources to buy extra books or hire a private tutor. Through such a rigid curriculum, teachers would not be able to tailor these student’s needs, and the students in inner-city areas would be even more discouraged to study. These students would eventually fall through the cracks while only the privileged would benefit. Therefore, such a policy should not be established because the national curriculum would be adverse in the long run.

	In summary, the policy to set a national curriculum should not be implemented due to the consequences stated above. The policy would adversely affect teachers and students. Thus, society should avoid set rules and instead encourage a student to be a jack-of-all-trades and learn a variety of subjects differently from other students.

Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.

University is a place where great minds gather, debate, study to make inspirational ideas. With this great benefit of university, some people argue that every person should be able to take advantage of it. However, I argue that the Government should not offer a free university who cannot afford the tuition, because it will make university a standard way of living and tarnish its original merit; a variety of avocations should be respected and people must create their unique ways of living without heavily relying on university.

To begin with, offering a free university to the poor will waste enormous time and resources. To be specific, some impoverished students, who do not want to miss the free opportunity, will eventually attend university without having a specific goal in their lives. Especially in Korea, where the majority of tuition is funded by the government, more than 80% of people take university degrees because they do not want to miss the cheap education opportunity. However, after graduation, many people end up studying for public officers or stable office jobs without utilizing what they have learned in the university. Therefore, not only did the government waste their money, the students spent several years of college learning unnecessary knowledge. Furthermore, for many jobs - cooks, artists, and mechanics - experience outside of the classroom such as, making food, creating artworks, repairing machines, are much more valuable than sitting in a university classroom. Thus, the government will waste enormous resources if they offer a free university.

On top of that, there are better ways to support unprivileged children more efficiently. Especially, these days, every person can learn by themselves without attending University. Consider the case of Coursera which was founded by a Stanford professor Andrew Ng, people conduct themselves at home by seeing the videos of any professor. With the advance of technology, Impoverished children who are eager to study can find many on-line resources that are comparable to University courses. Unconditional support for poor students for university will actually debilitate their ability to teach themselves; thus, the Government should encourage them to study themselves and provide them the high-quality of online resources.

Admittedly, it would be miserable for students to give up the chance of attending their dream university. In that case, the government should offer conditional financial support for students who cannot afford tuition. For example, the United States government is operating free federal loans for everyone; with the federal loan, students do not have to pay for interest until graduation. Also, there are plentiful scholarship opportunities for students who maintain a high GPA and study enthusiastically in their fields. Thus, Instead of offering free education, students are compelled to find jobs and become more responsible.

To sum up, not only the government but also students can waste numerous resources when the Government supports free tuition for the poor. Instead of being too lenient on the students, the Government should instill responsibility for students who need financial support.


Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.
Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.
Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field of study. Others believe that college students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.

[essay_sean]

One of the biggest concerns among students is choosing a field of study. There are some students who only consider their talents and interests, and others often neglect them only considering the job availability on the market. However, one should not neglect any of them because they are important factors when they advance their careers.

Firstly, choosing a field of study not only changes the next four year’s experience but often changes a student’s  entire life. For example, computer science students often spend their majority of time writing codes, and biology students spend hours in the labs writing lab reports. If one is not interested in these meticulous works, they should consider other fields as they will easily lose interest in the field so less likely to succeed. Alos, every student has different talents, the availability on the job markets should not be the sole contributor when students determine their future career. Following students’ interests and talents will make their four years of experience more fruitful and enjoyable.

Secondly, college should not be undermined as a mere stepping stone for the job markets. In the United States, people who score the highest grades in LSAT, which tests people’s aptitudes on studying law, are mostly students majoring in philosophy, not political science. Even if the study is not directly related to the job markets, students can have a wider perspective and build creative mindsets. Especially, today’s technological advance dramatically changed the job markets. So, it is not entirely possible for incoming freshmen to predict job availability after they graduate from school. If students have diverse knowledge in fields they are interested, they can be more adaptable to the changes of the job market. 

However, students may not want to spend their valuable time studying in fields that are not related to the job market. For example, many korean students end up studying for the civil service examination regardless of their majors. Especially, many highschool students have not experienced real fields which may have great impact on their interests too. For example, many students who live in Silicon Valley in California, decide to study engineering because there are many engineering companies around them. Therefore, students who have different field experience gradually get interested in a field which also guarantees their future employment. 

In conclusion, students should disregard neither their talents nor job availability, because both are significant factors. Therefore, people should encourage students to have many experiences and instill them to have an interest in what they can be the most lucrative later.

The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
Educational institutions should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.

# essay_ann

	In schools and various educational institutions, questioning can reap benefits and yield disadvantages. Children are usually taught by their parents to listen to their teachers, and as they enter middle and high schools, students are taught to discuss their thoughts and debate extensively. I disagree with the statement because students should not always question what they are taught.

	Indeed, students should sometimes question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively to correct mistakes. For example, when many people believed in the concept of geocentrism, the notion that the Earth was the center of the universe, Galileo Galilei was skeptical. He doubted this concept and then proved the heliocentric model, the notion that the sun is located at the center of the world. Since he questioned what others told him and challenged the teachings of the time, he rectified a misconception in the science field. In the same way, students should be advised to question some concepts and sometimes doubt what they are taught. Thus, at times, students should doubt their teachings.

	Furthermore, students should doubt their teachings and not accept matters passively since it can lead to societal progress and improvements. For instance, when human flight was not possible, the Wright brothers questioned the notion of flying. While previous experimenters developed different forms of the airplane, the Wright brothers questioned the impossibility of long flight and eventually designed an airplane with a strong engine and more effective wings and propellers. Since they doubted what people believed, the notion of human flight was developed. Similarly, students should sometimes question teachings in order to gain unbiased insight, improve their critical thinking skills, and reap the benefits on society at large. Such a compelling case explicitly reveals that questioning yields benefits in some cases.

	However, skepticism is not essential in all cases, and therefore, students should not always question what they are taught. Excessive questioning would actually prove harmful to students. In particular, the basic fundamentals of mathematics should not be further questioned. Such fundamentals as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are concepts that students are asked to memorize and apply in their studies. They should not be skeptical to accept these teachings because such questioning would only waste their time and prevent them from learning more advanced concepts. If students were to question everything all the time, it would undermine the authority of teachers and impede their learning progress. It may be better to accept teachings passively. Thus, students should not always question everything.

	In brief, questioning can yield benefits at times; however, students should not always doubt everything. Challenging others should be advised, but it should be allowed when it is done in moderation.


Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.

Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts.

While in certain academic fields and levels, fact learning appears to be the ideal method for the students, yet on a deeper inspection it is revealed that learning by absorbing the concepts and ideas behind the facts is vital for progress in those very fields too.

All parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools.

# Essay_Sean

	Due to smartphones and the internet, today's parents do not interact well with their children; many parents are ignorant of their daily lives at schools and their close friends. Therefore, some people argue that every parent should volunteer for school in order to build connections with their children. However, I will disagree with the recommendation because not all parents are able to volunteer, and students may be disappointed and frustrated due to their parents' absence or difference.

	Indeed, it is beneficial for schools to have volunteers because they can create diverse activities with more manpower. Specifically, some private schools in the United States have parents volunteering programs and it creates a positive impact on overall school events; they teach sports, hold events, and serve as test proctors. Therefore, some schools, especially which are short in cash, can operate some events efficiently with the help of students’ parents.

 However, mandating parents to volunteer in schools is excessive. Naturally, volunteering is ideal when people are not obligated, and not all parents want to volunteer. Some parents who need to focus on work or take personal time might feel burdensome for the volunteer. Furthermore, in most schools, there are hundreds of students in a class; therefore, some parents might be dissatisfied with the school system and break them. For example, some parents might stand against school policy and work in favor of their children by bribing or secretly giving a helping hand for their children. Thus, mandating all parents to volunteer at school will be demanding for parents and some obstinate and unethical parents can cause trouble.

On top of that, it might be uncomfortable for some children to bring their parents to the school. Especially, some students may not live with their parents because they are working overseas, divorced, or passed away. So, asking their parents to come to school must be frustrating to them. Moreover, having their parents at school might create factions among them. Naturally, students with rich and high-authority parents will attract other students and intimidate those who do not have one. Therefore, it is not advisable for every student to bring their parents, because there are different students with diverse parents. 

In summary, although requiring all parents to volunteer at schools is desirable for schools, many parents and students might disagree with the policy and cause troubles. Hence, volunteering should be voluntary for the sake of the school.

Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real learning.

# essay_ann

	In this fast-paced society, it is debatable whether innovations have been beneficial. In general households, while mothers discourage their children from using technology, fathers usually encourage them to embrace such devices. I disagree with the statement that these innovations impede students from real learning. This is because cutting-edge technology actually imparts knowledge in an effective manner and fosters innovation and curiosity.

	Indeed, it is undeniable that overemphasis on innovations, such as videos and computers, can be an impediment for students to actually learn. In this day and age, the hours spent with innovations are increasing at an unprecedented speed, and at the same time, the hours spent studying has been decreasing at an exponential rate. The couch potato generation exists since people are lying in front of the television for too many hours. Also, as students use the computer, they play computer games and video games for hours on end and neglect their homework and their general studies. Therefore, one can argue that excessive use of technologies has only hampered people from true learning.

	Nevertheless, when used moderately, these technologies actually reap benefits because they deliver knowledge. To illustrate, in elementary schools nationwide, teachers have implemented the positive use of computers in their history lessons. Learning strictly from history textbooks and passing out written tests can yield boredom and cause more students to fall through the cracks. Thus, history teachers have added the computer game “Oregon Trail” into their teaching curriculum. In this case, the use of computers cannot be seen as an impediment to learning since the game effectively inculcates students with the realities of the 19th century pioneer on the Oregon Trail through visual effects. Thus, adequate use of technology has effectively imparted knowledge to students and helped them learn at schools.

	Moreover, moderate use of technology has also played a more crucial role in our education as it yields creativity and curiosity. In particular, the National Geographic channel has had a positive impact on students in completing their science homework and projects. Since students are stimulated more by images than by words on a page, the television has been useful as they watch animals that they have learned about in class. With just one click of the remote control along with clicks on their computer mouse, students are able to acquire a wealth of information from TV channels and websites. State-of-the-art technologies help children to foster their imagination and help build a well-rounded and effective education. Thus, innovations can foster learning when used moderately.

	In short, innovations can help students to excel in their studies. Thus, people should encourage students to incorporate and moderatle use technological devices in their studies.

The best way for a society to prepare its young people for leadership in government, industry, or other fields is by instilling in them a sense of cooperation, not competition.

# essay_ets6

	Whenever people argue that history is a worthless subject or that there is nothing to be gained by just “memorizing a bunch of stupid names and dates,” I simply hold my tongue and smile to myself. What I’m thinking is that, as cliche as it sounds, you do learn a great deal from history (and woe to those who fail to learn those lessons). It is remarkable to think of the number of circumstances and situations in which even the most rudimentary knowledge of history will turn out to be invaluable. Take, for example, the issue at hand here. Is it better for society to instill in future leaders a sense of competition or cooperation? Those who have not examined leaders throughout time and across a number of fields might not have the ability to provide a thorough and convincing answer to this question, in spite of the fact that it is crucial to the future functioning of our society. Looking closely at the question of leadership and how it has worked in the past, I would have to agree that the best way to prepare young people for leadership roles is to instill in them a sense of cooperation.

	Let us look first at those leaders who have defined themselves based on their competitiveness. Although at first glance it may appear that a leader must have a competitive edge in order to gain and then maintain a leadership position, I will make two points on this subject. First, the desire to compete is an inherent part of human nature that is, it is not something that needs to be “instilled” in young people. Is there anyone who does not compete in some way or another every single day? You try to do better than others in your school work or at the office, or you just try to do better than yourself in some way, to push yourself. When societies instill competitiveness in their leaders, it only leads to trouble. The most blatant example in this case is Adolf Hitler, who took competition to the very extreme, trying to prove that his race and his country were superior to all. We do not, however, need to look that far to find less extreme examples (i.e., Hitler is not the extreme example that disproves the rule). The recent economic meltdown was caused in no large part by the leaders of American banks and financial institutions who were obsessed with competing for the almighty dollar. Tiger Woods, the ultimate competitor in recent golfing history and in many ways a leader who brought the sport of golf to an entirely new level, destroyed his personal life (and perhaps his career -- still yet to be determined) by his overreaching sense that he could accomplish anything, whether winning majors or sleeping with as many women as possible. His history of competitiveness is well documented; his father pushed him from a very early age to be the ultimate competitor. It served him well in some respects, but it also proved to be detrimental and ultimately quite destructive.

Leaders who value cooperation, on the other hand, have historically been less prone to these overreaching, destructive tendencies. A good case in point would be Abraham Lincoln. Now, I am sure at this point you are thinking that Lincoln, who served as President during the Civil War and who refused to compromise with the South or allow secession, could not possibly be my model of cooperation! Think, however, of the way Lincoln structured his Cabinet. He did not want a group of “yes men” who would agree with every word he said, but instead he picked people who were more likely to disagree with his ideas. And he respected their input, which allowed him to keep the government together in the North during a very tumultuous period (to say the least). My point in choosing the Lincoln example is that competitiveness and conflict may play better to the masses and be more likely to be recorded in the history books, but it was his cooperative nature that allowed him to govern effectively. Imagine if the CEO of a large company were never able to compromise and insisted that every single thing be done in exactly her way. Very quickly she would lose the very people that a company needs in order to survive, people with new ideas, people ready to make great advances. Without the ability to work constructively with those who have conflicting ideas, a leader will never be able to strike deals, reach consensus, or keep an enterprise on track. Even if you are the biggest fish in the pond, it is difficult to force your will on others forever; eventually a bigger fish comes along (or the smaller fish team up against you!). 

In the end, it seems most critical for society to instill in young people a sense of cooperation. In part this is true because we seem to come by our competitive side more naturally, but cooperation is more often something we struggle to learn (just think of kids on the playground). And although competitive victory is more showy, more often than not the real details of leadership comes down to the ability to work with other people, to compromise and cooperate. Getting to be President of the United States or the managing director of a corporation might require you to win some battles, but once you are there you will need diplomacy and people-skills. Those can be difficult to learn, but if you do not have them, you are likely to be a short-lived leader.

Requiring university students to take a variety of courses outside their major fields of study is the best way to ensure that students become truly educated.

# Essay_Sean

Most of the undergraduate and graduate programs require standardized test scores including math, reading, and writing. Even when they get into the institution, all students are required to take various writing, science, and math courses. It is because the current society prefers jack-of-all-trades to nerds whose vision is only confined in their respective fields.

	To begin with, studying various fields can help students to have a deeper insight in their own fields. For instance, history students can learn how to measure ages of different prehistoric bones by studying carbon decay in chemistry, and music students can edit and generate some notes if they learn different programming languages. These insights in other fields can be useful, especially when they advance their career.

	Also, students learn cooperation as they work with other students in different fields. To be specific, if someone is interested in start-up, he needs to have friends  who have different knowledge in law, marketing, and economy. On top of that, students can understand how their fields are related to others. Imagine a computer science student making a robot bird. He must know aerodynamics, electrical circuits, and math behind the mechanism. Also, as he takes economics and political class, he will understand the impact of his program on the society, and this will allow him to plan out his future goals. 

	Admittedly, universities should not overburden their students by requiring them to study non-relevant fields excessively. For example, someone who studies medicine does not need to  memorize details of European history. Also, if he is not talented in writing, he must spend more time in writing a history essay than in learning important biology related to his major.

To sum up, universities should require students to take different courses outside their major in order to have  broader perspective and personal relations. However, it should not be too much of a burden for students, so universities should give some degree of freedom in choosing courses.

	The reason that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated in cities does not necessarily reach the conclusion that governments should provide major cities financial support they need. The reason and the claim on which the claim is based is seriously flawed. Hence, I do not agree with it at all.

	Firstly, major cities are already thriving without the extra help from the government. Most metropolitan cities have developed businesses, factories along with highly developed infrastructure. Moreover, when tourists from overseas visit a nation, the priority to metropolitan cities is given. The implication is major cities already have enough sources of income that they can manage the city without external financial help from the government. For example, the city of Mumbai, a major city in India, forms upto 25 percent of the nation's GDP. Now the question one must ask is, does this city, and cities like this one, really need the financial help from the government? Therefore, it is more reasonable for the government to provide financial support in an area that mired in poverty.

	Moreover, the reason for the claim is dubious. Quite the contrary to what it states, most of the nation’s tradition and cultural heritage is preserved in the nation's countryside and not in the cities. For example, major cities in India depend upon the service industry as a primary source of income whereas many villages are still agrarian and depend upon traditional sources of income, ushc as handloom and various arts. Moreover, the cuisine of a nation, which is also a part of the nation's heritage, is best preserved in the countryside as compared to cities, where cuisine is heavily loaded with all sorts of preservatives. The examples above illustrate that the countryside and not the major cities help preserve the nation's cultural traditions.

	Building upon the last example of how villages help preserve cultural traditions, many times, because they are overlooked by the government, residents of these parts of the nation change their traditional businesses such as the business of making handmade ornaments due to the lack of funding and support. The point is that many cherished traditions are dying. Should the government provide financial help to such rare family businesses, they are sure to grow. In this way not only a cherished cultural tradition is preserved but also a rare form art is helped to survive.

	In conclusion, governments should rather focus on the countryside and other small towns rather than major cities because they are more likely to preserve cultural traditions and heritage. Financial help from the government will definitely help small cities and towns; which in turn will help the government itself.

Nations should pass laws to preserve any remaining wilderness areas in their natural state, even if these areas could be developed for economic gain.

[essay_ann]

	In the world, there are not many wilderness areas that exist, so some people would argue that extensive measures need to be taken to preserve nature. Therefore, even if these lands could be developed for economic gain, the policy should be implemented. nations should enact laws to preserve wilderness areas in their natural state.

	First of all, the policy to protect wilderness areas would reap benefits in regards to preserving the environment. If endeavors are not taken not taken to preserve these areas, there is a greater likelihood that humans would use these areas for purposes that are not environmentally friendly. Humans may engage in deforestation, and this would eventually have an adverse impact on the environment. Without laws protecting natural lands, humans would not think about the fact that trees give oxygen and help us breathe. Laws should be strictly enforced to hamper the escalation of global warming and greenhouse gas emissions. As we can see from the aforementioned case, wilderness areas need to be protected so that biodiversity can be maintained.

	Moreover, the policy to preserve the wilderness areas would play an indispensable role in the development of science and research. Some may argue that research should be conducted in parks and zoos. Although it can be done in artificial areas, it should be noted that the most successful studies have been possible in the natural state. Because of the Lewis and Clark expedition, people in this day and age are able to enjoy a better grasp of the Northwest’s natural resources. By embarking on this quest, not only were hundreds of animals and plants documented, but also the first accurate maps of the area were produced. With the implementation of the policy and first-hand experience in the wilderness, we would be better able to perceive the geography of the United States. Implementing the policy results in many advantages.

	Furthermore, the author believes that the implementation of the policy to preserve wilderness areas comes at the expense of economic gain. However, it should be emphasized that areas that are preserved in their natural state can also yield economic gain. In particular, the Amazon rainforest in Brazil is maintained for not only environmental reasons but also tourism. The government places restrictions on travel in certain areas in the Amazon to preserve the environment and culture of indigenous groups. At the same time, millions of travelers visit to see the greatness and experience the beauty of the rainforest. In the long run, the revenue obtained from tourists could even override the economic gain from the creation of homes and businesses. Wilderness helps preserve the culture and yield economic development for the country, so these lands should be preserved.

	In brief, the policy should be implemented so that nations pass laws to preserve the wilderness areas. Animals and humans can co-exist peacefully and experience a better economy.

History
Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.
[essay_ann]

In our society, the media heavily focuses on scandals. These scandals bring to light immoral behavior of certain people and highlight events that are unacceptable by the majority of people. I believe that scandals help people to focus their attention on societal problems ranging from the fields of politics to science. However, it should be emphasized that these problems could also be addressed by speakers and reformers.

First, scandals have reaped many benefits in the field of politics as they. The Watergate scandal during the presidency of Richard Nixon is a compelling example of a political scandal that revealed the consequences of a top political leader infringing upon the law. In order to be re-elected, President Nixon engaged in illicit activities, such as campaign fraud, illegal break-ins, and illegal wiretapping. After this scandal was disclosed to the public, he was forced to resign from the presidency. Because of the authority of this scandal, the public became aware of such grave problems, and further political corruption could be impeded. It should be noted that when the scandal deals with the elite, reformers may not be powerful enough to disclose details of these events.

Moreover, in the science field, scandals have been helpful in portraying problems that have been disregarded or overlooked. For example, Woo Suk Hwang, a South Korean scientist, claimed a stunning series of advances in cloning and stem cell research. Through pressures from the outside world and media scrutiny, he later admitted that critical parts of one discovery were fabricated. The scandal not only caused uproar from the outside world but also heightened awareness of the public to be informed of such problems in research. It was essential for this unethical behavior to be revealed through a scandal to emphasize the gravity of the situation in a way that individuals cannot. Scandals in various fields were useful in revealing societal problems which might have been overlooked by individuals.

Although scandals are useful in disclosing problems, the impact of scandals does not override the effect
of speakers. This is because distinguished individuals can also address societal issues. For example, Martin Luther King, a pioneer during the civil rights movement, addressed the problem of racial segregation to the American public. When racism was prevalent, King adamantly gave a speech called “I Have a Dream Speech” and took extensive measures to aid African-Americans to gain their rights by participating in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Scandals would most likely not be able to address racial problems that have been embedded in the society for a long time. In this case, reformers should continuously focus on such problems. Their hard work and activism can bring awareness and even abolish the Jim Crow Laws. Thus, reformers and speakers are also indispensable in addressing the issues of society that scandals cannot reveal.

	In brief, scandals can focus people’s attention on problems. However, people should lionize the reformers for their hard work and also contribute to the society at large.

[133] [Claim and Reason]

Claim: Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today.
Reason: The world today is significantly more complex than it was even in the relatively recent past.

[essay_ann]

	Society today has revolutionized at an unprecedented speed. With this fast-paced society, people may argue about the benefits and drawbacks by learning from historical events and people. I disagree with the claim because looking at the past can help people to make pivotal decisions. However, I agree with the reason that the world is more complex than ever before.

	Indeed, some people can argue that looking back at history would not help people in this day and age to make decisions. Understanding history would not be useful particularly in the development of transportation. In the past, people began using horse-drawn transportation. Then, in the 1900s, Henry Ford created an improved assembly line for automobile manufacturing which made the mass production of affordable automobiles possible. Nowadays, people are making decisions to improve automobiles by creating hybrid cars and electric cars. The process of transportation has developed so quickly that people cannot rely on the former.

	However, understanding the past does help those living in the present to make important decisions. This is because people can learn from their past mistakes and not repeat the same mistakes. For example, after the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima by the United States in 1945, the consequences of the nuclear weapons were made known to all of makind. Humans learned of the thousands of lives that were sacrificed and the illnesses that are still prevalent due to the side-effects of the radioactive chemicals. Historical events can inculcate people with lessons from the mistakes of the past. Thus, from this past event, the importance of anti-proliferation has been declared as a wide array of diplomatic negotiations and contracts have taken place. Therefore, history does help people today to make imperative decisions as they learn from their past mistakes.

	Furthermore, the reason is valid in stating that current society is very complex. Compared to the past, the world has changed. Because of the complexity of the world, means of communication developed quickly. In the 1990s, when cellphones were thought to be the only means of communication, the internet was created. Within a decade, smartphones were invented, and nowadays, companies are annually coming up with newer versions. However, it should be noted that the complexity of the world does not hinder people from learning about the past and making wise decisions. The communication process has developed very quickly and is so complicated; however, people can still rely on the former to help them to make present decisions. Hence, people can still rely on the former to help them to make present decisions. Hence, the society is considerably more complex than in the past, but this does not negatively affect people. The past still helps them.

	In summary, although our current society is complex, it does not mean that the past provides little guidance. People should study the past because it provides many valuable lessons.

Leadership
Claim: In any field—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years.
Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.
Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.

# Essay_Sean

	Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that affirms one's prior belief. With limited information given to public mass, they are susceptible to believe in fabricated knowledge which can undermine the safety of the nation. History also proves that effective leaders often are rigid and do not compromise with the public.

First of all, an effective leader should persuade the public to have advisable opinions without yielding to their opinion. For example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is praised for his consistent adherement in his principles of government intervention in the economy during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the United States people lost faith in their national bank; therefore, the bank almost went bankrupt and the depression could have been worsened. However, Roosevelt proclaimed a bank holiday and gave a famous speech on radio, called Fireside Chat - claiming the stability of the bank and instilling patriotism in their people. Therefore, many people even decided to deposit their money to the bank, and the government could successfully overcome the financial difficulty. Thus, it behoves political leaders to remain consistent principles and objectives in order to prevent disorder from their uninformed people.

Moreover,  definite principles and objectives make leaders pursue their goal more effectively. South African activist Nelson Mandela is a great example of a political leader who consistently believed in mass formations of black people for the democratic movement. He first joined African National Congress and proceeded in a peaceful way of protest called the defiance campaign that united black people in coordinated civil disobedience. However, the oppressive government suppressed those movements and banned Mandela from the ANC. However, he continued to protest in an armed way, and even though he was incarcerated, he never stopped enlightening and bonding black people. Later, his continuous commission of the activist movement bore fruit, so he became the first black president of South Africa. Therefore, an effective leader must remain consistent in order to achieve the ultimate goal.

However, in this fast-changing world, effective leaders must listen to their publics especially in technological issues. Specifically, many laws are impeding scientific progress from genetically modified organisms, gene manipulation to unmanned vehicles. Because Chinese president Xi Jinping yielded to those scientists, he alleviated those regulations and provided financial support to them. Now, Beijing became the first city to allow testing autonomous vehicles on public roads and China became one of the fastest growing nations in those cutting-edge-technology.

Therefore, effective political leaders should remain consistent on their principles and objectives to enlighten the public. However, in this fast-changing world, the political leaders should take notice in public opinion so that the government follows the pace of the society.

	Definitely both amateurs and professionals make contributions to society, so it is debatable which person has a more significant impact on others. I disagree with the statement because the expert can also make contributions. Although the beginner can positively contribute to society in some fields, it does not apply to any field of inquiry.

	Granted, the beginner can yield more imperative results in some fields, such as business. This is because novices are more likely to be risk-taking and creative than experts. Bill Gates, known as one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in the computer revolution, is lionized by many people. He was an amateur when he first began his company, Microsoft. As a college dropout, he started his own company with his close friend with a lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise. Even though he was considered an expert at that time, his successful company can be contributed to his risk-taking and innovative thoughts, which exist mainly in beginners. The beginner can sometimes make more vital contributions to society, so the layperson should not be undermined.

	Moreover, in the political field, the beginner can yield more crucial contributions to society since he is equipped with passion, a quality that is not ubiquitous among most experts. To illustrate, Dorothea Dix, a beginner at that time, was a catalyst in reforming the conditions of prisons. During this time, many believed that the conditions of prisons did not need to be altered because a majority of citizens believed they were hopeless. Thus, professionals neglected this issue to focus on more crucial matters. However, Dix witnessed first-hand the adverse conditions of prisons and went the extra mile to change the detrimental conditions. Beginners are likely to make significant changes since they have enthusiasm and eagerness to change their surroundings and circumstances. Ordinary individuals can thus contribute more to society in political fields.

	However, in the field of science, important contributions should be left in the hands of experts since knowledge and resources play an indispensable role. In other words, the beginner is likely to make contributions not in any field. With the advent of World War II, the Manhattan Project was guided by the scientific director Robert Oppenheimer, who contributed to the development of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer was not an amateur in the field; he was an expert who had conducted a wide array of studies before. Through his expertise, he was able to successfully guide other scientists in the creation of the atomic bomb, and in return, other people trusted him. Thanks to his abundant experience, the scientists were able to learn from him, incorporate the vast knowledge into their current project, and eventually alleviate the fears of the United States citizens. Thus, more emphasis should be placed on experts in the field of science due to their contributions to the society at large.

[53] [statement]

If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it is justifiable.

	
	Throughout history, many successful people have compromised on moral matters in order to achieve their goal. So, some people might think that the fastest and surest way to achieve one’s goal is to take any possible means. However, there are serious consequences as one does not take a right and moral means.

	Admittedly, for some leaders, minor deception can be useful for the sake of his people’s safety. For example, Franklin Roosevelt suffered from polio, so he was permanently paralized from the waist down. However, when making public speeches, he used a lectern in order to support his weight to show his strong image. Also, during the depression, he deliberately misled his people by guaranteeing the nation bank’s safety. These minor dishonest actions helped him to gain the public’s trust and he could save the nation from the biggest depression in the American history. Therefore, minor deception can be useful without causing significant harm.

	Even if some minor deception is acceptable, greater misconduct often brings irreversible consequences. During World War II, many scientists conducted research on different weapons; the most famous project was called the Manhattan Project which weaponized nuclear energy. Even if the weapon was not fully tested, the head of the Manhattan Project, Robert Oppenheimer decided to launch nuclear in order to finish a long lasting war. Although the goal of ending a war is worth it, it brought unexpected side effects. Many innocent people were killed and even after decades, people who were exposed to nuclear weapons had to suffer from radioactivity, such as cancers, deformed children, and skin diseases. Now the US is paying an enormous amount of money to help victims, and nuclear is now considered a threat to humanity. In this case, it is clearly seen that even if one's goal is worthy, he should be wary of the impact of his action. 

	On the other hand, one can yield greater impact if he takes right and justified means. Specifically, a South African activist, Nelson Mandela took a peaceful approach in order to gain support from the world. During his time, black people could not share public parks, bus seats, and schools under a law called Apartheid. Many black people became furious and caused many commotions around the country. However, Mandela who believed in peaceful protest, made speeches and educated black people how unjustful the discrimination was and suggested a peaceful way of protest. Even when he became president, he remained peaceful. Even black people rejected a rugby as a sport of apartheid, Nelson Mandela gave a hug to a caption of rugby World Cup team as a gesture of reconcillation. Thus, his peaceful way of acting attracted much support from the world and became more effective than any other measures. (X)
 
	In summary, minor misdemeanor may be acceptable in order to achieve one’s goal. However, compromising on greater moral matters often brings negative consequences and following justified means usually elicit support from greater people. Therefore, one should not take unethical and immoral means in order to achieve one’s goals.

The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.

[essay_sean]

Confirmation bias is a tendency to search and believe information that affirms one's beliefs. So, many people often do not trust authority in different fields who have deep knowledge in their fields. Some people criticize those behaviors as they can cause disorders in their fields.  However, history proves that many activists and scientists developed the society by challenging people in authority. Therefore, I believe that when many people question authority, the society can enjoy prosperity.

Admittingly, people should not question their authority when the time is exigent and cooperation of its people is needed. Specifically, banks in the United States 1920s were dire in money because many people thought the bank would not be able to give back their money. So, Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed a bank holiday and gave a famous speech with radio called Fireside chat - rebuilding confidence in the national banking system. So, many patriotic people deposited their money in the time of depression, so many banks could escape from bankruptcy. Therefore, the well-being of a society was enhanced because general people did not question its authority and worked together without questioning Roosevelt. 

However, in many cases, power tends to corrupt people in authority. People in authority make unfair laws and regulations in order to keep their place. Thus, it behoves people to question their authority and renovate those system. Especially Nelson Mandela is a great example who successfully challenge authority and improved society. During his time, black people in South Africa was discriminated under a law called apartheid - black people had to use different beaches, and public restrooms. Mandela questioned this unfair treatment to black people and decided to enlighten many other black people. Even Mandela himself was incarcerated and government kept suppressed his effort, many centralized black people became a threat to the Government - in 1990, Mandela was released and the Aparthied was annulled. This chain of events clearly shows that when many people combine effort, they can entirely improve their society.

Moreover, questioning authority promotes creativity and brings revolutionary impacts on society. Even at an early age, students are provided with the freedom to ask and raise objections to their teachers. Students who do not passively absorb from authority’s ideas often create a new way of thinking in certain ideas and concepts in every field. For example, the founder of a company Coursera, Andrew Ng challenged the standard way of teaching by creating a biggest online learning platform. At first, many institutions and educators in authority did not approve people in authority Therefore, he decided to teach underprivileged students around the world and changed the paradigm of education; currently, Coursera has more than 30 million registered users and more than 3000 courses. Without people like Ng who continually think of more creative ways to change the world, well-being of society will not be easily improved. X

To sum up, questioning authority will bring well-being to the society by correcting unfair society and bringing creative ideas into the society. However, sometimes cooperation of their people might be more significant. Therefore, people should keep close attention to their authorities and think along with them in order to make a better society.

[essay_ann]

There are many issues of concern, and politicians should make it their priority to focus on problems that are affecting the society at large. Whether today’s problems should be the main focus is debatable. I believe that the recommendation is valid, so governments should focus more on solving immediate rather than future issues.

Granted, in environmental circumstances, the recommendation would prove adverse. The government should work on solving future problems since they can become bigger problems in the near future and adversely affect more people. To illustrate, the problem of global warming is a long-term problem that society must solve. As the average temperature of the Earth’s air and oceans is increasing, many governments are going the extra mile to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions to slow down the acceleration of global warming. Being aware of the possible harm of this future problem, many countries have joined the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the governments’ endeavors to overcome this future problem, the environment is not deteriorating quickly and not adversely affecting plants, animals, and humans. All things considered, governments must take extensive measures to solve the anticipated problems.

However, in circumstances dealing with people’s health, handling immediate problems would reap benefits. The recommendation is valid since these issues are urgent and people’s lives are at stake. About a decade ago, the swine flu pandemic, which occurred in Mexico, yielded a series of deaths in the United States and other countries. Since then, political leaders have gone through great lengths to reduce the number of people suffering from the illness by closing schools and public and private buildings. Because the governments immediately acknowledged the importance of these issues, they did not neglect the immediate problems and as a result their citizens avoided imminent danger. Hence, it is essential for governments to focus on solving the immediate and pressing problems.

Moreover, recommending governments to solve current problems is needed, especially in economic circumstances. For example, the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 eventually resulted in the global financial crisis. At this time, the collapse of major financial institutions and the decline in the stock market threatened the world economy. Thousands of citizens were tight on cash, and the unemployment rate rose. As a result, the United States government made incessant efforts to solve the current problems so that more citizens would not be at serious risk. The government placed emphasis on immediate problems so that it would not take a toll on many citizens. Therefore, immediate problems override future problems.

In summary, the circumstances mentioned above demonstrate that the government should focus on solving immediate problems. By doing so, citizens can live in a more peaceful world.

Religion has been ubiquitous ever since humanity started on earth. Therefore, the highest ideals of the society are revealed in the heroic story of those religious leaders: Gotama in Siddhartha started Buddhism with many disciples, and Jesus Christ spread Christianity with his love and sacrifice. Indeed, it is reasonable to study the heroes and role models in order to evaluate a society. However, I believe that, especially in modern society, there are other better ways to understand a society.

Before the internet has been widely disseminated, people had to gather in order to share thought and belief. In the early 20th century, black people in South Africa were not allowed to use the same schools and other public facilities as whites under the law called apartheid. In order to gain fundamental rights, black people gathered around Nelson Mandela and elected him as a leader of the African National Congress. With continuous efforts, he united the country that had been divided along racial lines. Later, Mandela was awarded Nobel prize for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime. As we can see from this example, 20th-century people chose Mandel as leader and hero as he revealed a society’s highest ideals of civil rights.

However, in the 21st century, evaluating the character of society through its leader and role models is antiquated. Unlike the past, people communicate, gather information, and create cultures within the internet. Especially, one of the largest social network platforms Facebook has more than a billion users who are representatives of the society. One study shows that average people spend more than 2 hours per day on the social network every day. People share their daily lives, debate ideas, and talk about social problems. Thus, the best way to understand the character of a society is by looking at the social network.

On top of that, modern technology provides us with more free time than previous generations. The car, computer, and phone all release additional time for people to live more efficiently. Therefore, people tend to make their personal hobbies and interests, rather than following a hero and role model whom they admire. For instance, Youtube, one of the largest video-sharing platforms, clearly reveals that today's people tend to make their own culture. People can easily make videos and upload, and every person can see the content instantly. So, even famous musicians, sports players, cooks, and politicians make their videos in order to attract people. To sum up, there are so many kinds of people in these words, so it is oversimplifying the culture of society by looking at just some leaders or role models. 

In summary, in previous eras, it was the best way to examine role models and leaders in order to understand a society. However, people these days have diverse interests which can be easily analyzed through the internet. Therefore, the best way to evaluate a society is by looking at social media and user-created content on the internet. 

[23] [Recommendation]

Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.
							
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In the course of history, scientific development has been both beneficial and detrimental to our society. Guidelines and regulations should be made according to its outcomes. I agree with the recommendation that the government should place few or no restrictions on scientific research, especially in the circumstances of technology and medicine.

	Indeed, having many restrictions on research should be recommended in dire circumstances. The government should place a lot of regulations when the lives of citizens are at stake. To illustrate, the people who participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II created the first atomic bombs. The United States government gained the support of the United Kingdom and Canada, and as a result, thousands of people were hired and billions of dollars were invested. Governments should have many restrictions on research dealing with the production and development of weapons, so that people’s lives would not be sacrificed. The devastating effects of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki certainly demonstrate that government regulations are vital for the safety of the nations and the entire world. When research is conducted without restrictions, much detriment can result; thus, restrictions should be placed.

	However, in circumstances of technological advancement, the recommendation that governments should place few or no restrictions would prove effective. For example, the International Space Station has been able to reap benefits due to the absence of restrictions. Because many governments worldwide have been participating in this research, the station has been able to provide a unique environment for the testing of the spacecraft systems that will be paramount for missions to the Moon and Mars. Since the governments placed few limitations on this research, quick progress was not delayed, and humans could be aware of presence outside Earth. Thus, scientific development should not be impeded.

	Moreover, the recommendation should be carried out in circumstances regarding people’s health. Politicians should initiate few restrictions on scientific development on behalf of the citizens. Through the Human Genome Project, a 13 year project designated by the United States government, researchers have been able to identify thousands of genes in the human DNA. Since no restrictions were prevalent, progress in the field of health care has increased significantly, and the U.S. government has been able to help a plethora of people who have been diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. The lack of regulations leads to the continuous development of humanity and prosperity of society. Thus,s governments should not impose restrictions on medical research for such research yield a higher life expectancy.

	In summary, the recommendation that the government should place few or no restrictions on scientific research is sound. Since the positive results outweigh the adverse outcomes, scientific research should be conducted without boundaries.

	The recommendation presents a view that I would agree is successful most of the time, but one that I cannot fully support due to the “all or nothing” impression it gives.

	Certainly as an educator I agree fully that the best way to elicit a positive response from students is to make use of students’ positive energy and then  encourage actions that you would like to see repeated. It is human nature that we all want to be accepted and achieve on some level, and when people in authority provide feedback that we have done something well, the drive to repeat the action that was praised is bound to be particularly strong.

	The blanket statement would obviously pay dividends in situations in which a teacher desires to have students repeat particular behaviors. For example, if an educator is attempting to teach students proper classroom etiquette, it would be appropriate to openly praise a student who raises his or her hand when wishing to speak or address the class. In such cases, the teacher may also help shape positive behaviors by ignoring a student who is trying to interject without approval from the teacher. In fact, the decision to ignore students who are exhibiting inappropriate behaviors of this type could work very well in this situation, as the stakes are not very high and the intended outcome can likely be achieved by such a method. However, it is important to note here that this tactic would only be effective in such a “low-stakes” situation, as when a student speaks without raising her hand first. As we will discuss below, ignoring a student who hits another student, or engages in more serious misdemeanors, would not be effective or prudent.

	To expand on this point, it is important for teachers to be careful when working with the second half of this statement, only ignoring negative actions that are not serious. Take for instance a student who is misbehaving just by chatting with a fellow classmate. This student might not be presenting much of a problem and may be simply seeking attention. Ignoring the student might, in fact, be the best solution. Now assume the negative action is the improper administration of chemicals in a science experiment or the bullying of a fellow student. To ignore these negative actions would be absurd and negligent. Now you are allowing a problem to persist, one that could potentially lead to much bigger and more dangerous issues. In a more serious situation, addressing the negative actions quickly and properly could stop the problem in its tracks. It is for reasons like that I do not advocate the idea that a teacher can be successful by simply ignoring negative actions.

	I do, however, greatly support the idea that the central focus of teaching should be to build on and encourage positive actions. However, the author’s all-encompassing statement leaves too many negative possibilities for the classroom. Perhaps a better way to phrase this statement would be to say, “The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones that are not debilitating to class efficiency or the safety of any individual”.

	Thus, in the original statement, there are indeed some good intentions, and there could be a lot of merit in adopting its basic principles. Data proves that positiver support can substantially increase motivation and desire in students and contribute to positive achievements. In fact, most studies of teaching efficacy indicate that praising positive actions and ignoring negative ones can create a more stable and efficient classroom. It needs to be stressed, however, that this tool is only effective at certain levels of misbehavior. As mentioned above, when the behavior is precipitated by feelings of revenge, power or total self-worthlessness, this methodology will likely not work. It is likely to be very successful, however, when the drive behind the misbehavior is simple attention seeking. In many of these instances, if the teacher demonstrates clearly that inappropriate behavior does not result in the gaining of attention, students are more likely to seek attention by behaving properly. Should the student choose this path, then ignoring has worked and when the positive behavior is exhibited, then the teacher can utilize the first part of the theory and support or praise this behavior. Now it is much more likely to be repeated. If the student does not choose this path and instead elects to raise the actions to a higher level that presents a more serious issue, then ignorance alone cannot work and other methods must be employed.

	In conclusion, one can appreciate the credo expressed in this instance, but surely we all can see the potential error of following it through to the extreme.

Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In schools, the satisfaction of students and teachers is crucial. Accordingly, some people may believe that teachers should be paid based on their students’ grades. However, I believe that the salary of teachers should not be based on the academic performance of their students.

	Indeed, some people may believe that basing the salary of teachers on their student’s grades can be beneficial. In big technology companies and department stores across the United States, employers offer their employees commision-based pay. Instead of having a set and fixed salary, these firms believe that a salary based on their employees’ performance would motivate them to work harder. In return, this would help increase the company's sales and profits. Similarly, pay based on the performance of students would encourage teachers to inculcate their students with more concepts in efficient ways. The motivation to succeed would eventually increase competition among teachers and create a healthy yet competitive environment. Thus, paying educators based on the grades of their students may yield benefits in a few aspects.

	However, paying teachers according to the academic performance of students can be detrimental to teachers in more aspects. This is because they would solely focus on increasing academic performance on standardized tests. The performance of students would be measured based on statewide and nationwide standardized tests. Thus, educators would focus only on subjects that are tested on the standardized tests - reading, writing, and mathematics - and focus less on other subjects like history, language, and performing arts. Students are then forced to learn only what is on the standardized tests as teachers “Teach to the test”. This may force teachers to limit their teachings and eventually hamper creativity and a well-rounded education. In such a case, having the salary of educators depend on the student’s grades would actually yield more drawbacks.

	Moreover, providing a salary based on the performance of students would have an adverse impact on students, especially impoverished students. This system would take a toll on the minorities or those mired in poverty since a majority of teachers would avoid teaching students who are poor and undereducated. Teachers would not be encouraged to tailor to these students’ needs, and the students in inner-city areas would be even more discouraged to study. Instead, most of the teachers would flock towards schools located in affluent areas which usually have students who are highly educated so that teachers can be paid more. Therefore, paying teachers based on the performance of their students would have an adverse effect in the long run.

	In summary, despite a few advantages, teachers should not be paid according to the academic performance of students. This would adversely affect teachers and students.

Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	Scientific research has its vice and virtue. Research can be beneficial in some cases as it raises the standard of living. In other cases, it can be harmful as it destroys humanity and creates fear within the society. The recommendation states that governments should not fund all scientific research because the consequences may be unpredictable. I believe that in certain circumstances the government should be able to fund research despite the unclear outcomes.

	Granted, the recommendation is somewhat credible since some scientific research with consequences that are unclear should not be funded. This is because adverse results can be yielded in circumstances like nuclear scientific research. During World War II, the United States government heavily invested in the Manhattan Project, thus resulting in the invention of the atomic bomb. At first, the U.S. implemented this project as a means of defense against Germany who was creating nuclear weapons. However, this invention not only killed thousands in the past but also threatens humans even today. Because the consequences of this research remained unclear in the long run, thousands of people's lives have been sacrificed, and illnesses due to the after-effects of the radioactivity are still prevalent today.

	However, recommending governments not to fund all scientific research with unpredictable outcomes would limit the potential of research. In these circumstances, government funding is necessary. To illustrate, many people believe stem cell research to be controversial since it involves the creation, usage, and destruction of human embryos. Pro-life advocates state that the research infringes upon the right to live and is also regarded as murder. Although the research results are unclear, governments should still take extensive measures to fund such research since the benefits outweigh the detriments. Because of such funding, new body parts can be produced, and illnesses that were life-threatening are now curable. In light of the circumstances above, despite the unclear results, scientific research can be funded for medical development.
		
Furthermore, space scientific research has consequences that are unclear but it should still be funded. Despite their vague results, government funding is essential for societal progress. The United States government heavily invested in NASA, therefore resulting in the space race. At first, most people believed that the US would not be able to catch up with the Soviet Union as it already had its first human in space. The outcomes seemed unclear because the US was already behind, and investment seemed to be a waste of time and money. However, the government pursued its goal of sending their first American safely to the Moon. Although the consequences of this research remained unclear in the long run, with continuous funding from the government, space exploration was possible, and the US was able to lead this new phase in American history. Thus, the government should fund research despite the vague results.

In brief, governments should be recommended to fund some scientific research despite the unclear consequences. Not all research with unclear purposes should be avoided. People should never hamper what researchers should study because we never know what kind of unintended results the studies may yield.

[brainstorm]

Interests should be part of the consideration as it acts as a catalyst motivating students in their learning. However, educators might need to be cautious in adopting suggestions from students as they are not always reliable and accountable in various respects


Not feasible to satisfy every student’s need

Primarily, the syllabus should be deemed appropriate to cater to the needs of the majority. Since not all students share the same interest or learning capability, it is likely to take up a lot of time and effort to try to plan the course in accordance to all requests proposed by students.

Well-rounded students

A mathematician who knows only about math and knows nothing about the ancient civilizations whose cultures discovered geography will be ill-suited to make math interesting to his future students or to understand the real world implications of the equations he slaves over daily.

The existence of knowledge in a wider range of disciplines will only provide the student with more information with which to take charge in a world that is highly complex and rapidly changing all the time, and so allowing them to experiment a little and change their mind once or twice is to their benefit rather than to their detriment.

Educator’s role to interest students

Interest can find more possibility of students and cultivate their creativity and curiosity for learning. Educators should consider the interests of students as they act as relentless impetus propelling students forward with their academic and professional performance. Admittedly, in a classroom setting, one of the missions embraced by educators should be the potential to capture the attention of the students. In order to achieve this goal, many teachers have adopted various creative teaching methods by incorporating students' interests and desires into the scheme. For instance, students are more responsive towards media and digital means, thus, audio-visual medians are considered effective in improving the overall teaching quality.

Therefore, students’ desire to learn can be propelled when they are interested in what they are taught, consequently, educators should adjust their courses more compatible with students’ suggestions and interests. However, educators should meticulously distinguish their thoughts behind interests and suggestions they give and then make accurate designs of their curriculum, better instilling students what they should learn.

Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In this highly competitive society, humans are born with the mentality to survive and succeed. Children, students, and employees all experience rivalry of some sort in their lives, and such intense rivalry has its benefits and drawbacks. I believe that competition for high grades does not limit the quality of education in all levels of education. Competition may not be vital in elementary schools. However, in middle school, high school, college, and graduate school, competition is essential.

	Indeed, competition for high grades impedes the quality of learning in elementary school. Students at a young age are beginning to learn the basics of each subject. When learning the fundamental rules of mathematics or the foundation of the United States, students should be taught in a stress-free environment. If students were to compete for high grades in elementary and middle school, some may fall through the cracks and may be discouraged to learn basic knowledge. In such a case, elementary school students would prosper without excessive competition. All things considered, in primary levels of education, competition for grades may certainly take a toll on students.

	Although being competitive and wanting high grades limit the quality of education in primary levels of education, competition is not adverse in all education levels. In middle and high school, competition for high grades actually fosters the quality of learning of students. Take standardized tests and class ranking for example. Since middle and high school students are already familiar with basic concepts and foundational concepts for each subject, competition is vital for students to move onto advanced studies. In the United States, as high school students prepare for a variety of standardized tests, including the SAT college entrance examination, they are motivated to study hard. Class rank, GPA, and other forms of competition for high grades act as an impetus for students to study and succeed. In light of the case above, competing for high grades stimulates students in secondary levels of education.

	Furthermore, in college and graduate school, competing for grades can act as a driving force for students to learn. Students have already chosen their majors and fields of interest, so competition is essential for them to extensively build upon their basic knowledge. In this way, they can master their knowledge in these advanced levels of education and hone their respective skills. Since college and graduate school students will experience fierce competition later on in their workforce, they should familiarize themselves with this competitive atmosphere beforehand to accomplish more. Thus, in tertiary levels of education, competition for high grades does not hamper the quality of education.




[49] [Claim and Reason]

Claim: We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from those whose views contradict our own.
					
Reason: Disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In today’s increasingly globalized world, people try to emphasize their differences. Leaders worldwide encourage diversity by learning from their surroundings. I disagree with the claim because people can learn as much from those whose viewpoints contradict their own. Also, the reason is invalid because disagreement does not impede learning.

	Granted, in a few cases, those with similar viewpoints can inculcate people with many crucial teachings. This is because birds of a feather flock together, and people naturally tend to surround themselves with people with similar interests. For example, when the Catholic Church believed in geocentrism, Nicolaus Copernicus censured this theory and stated that the heliocentric model was valid. The heliocentric model proved that the sun was actually the center of the universe. At that time, no one believed in Copernicus; however, later, Galileo actually adhered to the teachings of Copernicus and fought on his behalf. Because both forerunners in the field of astronomy shared similar views, Galileo was able to learn much from his predecessor. Therefore, learning from people with similar views can be better to maximize and strengthen their learning potential.

	However, more often, people with different perspectives can learn more from each other. For instance, high school students are encouraged to participate in debate clubs and Model United Nations to foster their debate skills and learn from people with opposing opinions. History also provides examples of the benefits of learning from different people. When women were deemed inferior to men, women were not allowed to readily access jobs and be granted the right to vote. However, Susan B. Anthony castigated this view and infringed upon the New York law by voting. Because Anthony had contradictory views, women were able to break the glass ceiling. She inculcated others with the notion that social norms could be erroneous. Had people relied on others with similar views out of comfort, this agreement could have hampered learning. Hence, people can learn more from people with opposing views.

	Moreover, the reason is not sound because disagreement does not yield stress and inhibit learning. In the highly-acclaimed novel To Kill a Mockingbird, the prominent lawyer Atticus Finch censures the societal norm of racial segregation. At a time when the Jim Crow Laws were prevalent, society adamantly believed that black people were inferior to white people. However, due to the contrasting views of Finch, his children Jem and Scout learned about the injustice of racial segregation. They learned more than other students due to the disagreements given by their father. They embraced people with different ethnicities and backgrounds and were not stressed out by his dissenting opinions. Thus, disagreement does not lead to stress and instead fosters learning, so people should embrace differences.

	In brief, being surrounded by people with different views can be vital in the learning process. This is because disagreement does not yield stress and inhibit learning. Hence, people should broaden their horizons and challenge others.

Many important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.


[essay_ann]

	Throughout the course of history, there have been various discoveries, and there has been a constant debate whether the most crucial discoveries are planned or not. I disagree with the statement since many pivotal discoveries and creations are not accidental. The hard work and extraordinary efforts of researchers should not be undermined.

	Admittedly, few discoveries were unintentional. Although luck can help people to discover something significant, people should be aware that these instances are rare. For instance, Louis Pasteur conducted a series of experiments and did not intend on discovering the concept of immunization and vaccination. While experimenting with many germs and bacteria in his laboratory, he accidentally discovered other theories that helped cure and prevent diseases. Many of the scientific discoveries in the past can be seen as accidental due to the lack of cutting-edge technology at that time that limited further research. Although these findings may be few in number, when people seek an answer to one question, they are able to stumble upon an answer to another question. Because accidental discoveries are limited to the past, it should be noted that only a few cases exist.

Despite the case above, many more examples prove that significant discoveries are intentional. This is because patience is a requirement to succeed. Specifically, Charles Darwin, a prominent scientist, pursued his interest in marine biology. He went the extra mile to conduct studies that proved the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest. His discoveries were not accidental, which are proven through his incessant efforts and patience. He decided to embark on a quest to the Galapagos Islands and planned on studying bird finches to discover concrete evidence that would prove his theories. A lot of researchers including Darwin were determined and patient, so they were able to advance the field of science. In this regard, a majority of discoveries are not coincidental.

Furthermore, in this present day, most imperative discoveries are and will continue to be intentional. With state-of-the-art technology and increasing competition, researchers must strive to make creations possible in this current society. Steve Jobs and his creation of the Apple smartphone was only possible with the hard work and perseverance of his staff members. They decided to combine the role of the telephone and the Internet into one device, and the company invested a significant amount of money, time, and resources to make the device possible. The creation of the smartphone and many other devices could only have been planned since the employees only sought to find an answer to their original question. Without people’s hard work, these current products would not be realized, thus proving that the majority of creations in the future should also be planned.

In brief, although a few discoveries and creations were accidental, it can be explicitly stated that most vital discoveries were planned. Luck would play a minor role in people’s daily lives.

Every individual in a society has a responsibility to obey just laws and to disobey and resist unjust laws.


[essay_ann]

Robert E. Lee once said, “Obedience to lawful authority is the foundation of manly character”. That said, there is no doubt that all people should follow fair laws. However, stating that every person should disobey unjust laws is controversial. I partially agree with the claim because all people can certainly obey just laws. However, all individuals should not disobey unjust laws.

First, it is undeniable that each individual has a responsibility to obey just laws. This is because fair laws are based on morals and rationality and exist to maintain justice within the nation. To illustrate, in many states in the United States, the use of cellphones while driving is prohibited. Due to the rising number of car accidents, this law was enacted in these states in hopes of decreasing collisions. By following this just law, every citizen can contribute to safer roads and a safer society. Everybody should adhere to this fair law since it is for the benefit and safety of all citizens and society at large. As explicitly revealed in the above example, all individuals should definitely abide by just laws.

Even though the issue regarding obedience to fair laws can be agreed by all, the issue dealing with unfair laws seems to be a bit more complex. Some may believe that people can disobey unjust laws because citizens have the right to voice their opinions and dissatisfaction and fight to eliminate unfairness. During the American Revolution, the colonists adamantly opposed the tea tax, which was enforced by the British Parliament. They felt the law was unfair since it infringed upon their right to be taxed only by their own elected representatives. As a result, the colonists decided to protest the British control in an event called the Boston Tea Party. As a sign of resistance, the colonists boarded ships and destroyed the tea by throwing it into the Boston Harbor. They disobeyed the unfair law, which led to American independence. All things considered, some citizens have to be responsible and resist unjust laws when necessary.

However, not every individual has a duty to resist unfair laws. Since people have a different view on ethics and rationale, allowing everyone to disobey unjust laws may yield social confusion. In South Africa, due to apartheid, blacks were not granted their fundamental rights. For almost fifty years, basic education, medical care and other services were segregated. They were not allowed to use the same schools and other public facilities as whites because of the unfair laws. Nelson Mandela deemed such rules as unjust and infringed upon the law by fighting to abolish apartheid Mandela resisted the unfair law with peaceful measures, but not all people should do the samne because violence would cause chaos and deeper conflict within the society. Laws are societal rules that should be followed to maintain stability within the nation. Hence, not every person should disobey and resist unjust laws.

In summary, individuals have a responsibility to obey fair laws, but not all people should disobey unfair laws. In this way, members of society should make extraordinary efforts to create and maintain a peaceful nation.

Unfortunately, in contemporary society, creating an appealing image has become more important than the reality or truth behind that image.

[essay_Sean]

	Today's people want to show off their lives on social media. Even though they are not content with their lives, they create an appealing image in order to seem happy. Some people argue that those images are fake, so should be ignored. However, I will argue that creating compelling images has been a significant part of our daily lives.


	Admittedly, the reality and truth behind the images should not be neglected. Especially in history, there have been numerous incidents when specious nations have collapsed for various reasons. For example, the last dynasty of China, the great Qing dynasty, has been respected among all asian nations. Since, many asian countries followed the Qing’s images and adapted into their cultures; food, clothes, and languages have spread all over the country. However, those specious images have easily disappeared as European countries invaded with state-of-art weapons. Even if those European countries lacked long cultures and fame, they had a stronger army and defeated the Qing’s dynasty. Therefore, decent images were often broken by others.

	However, with the increased technology of communication, those images can be a powerful weapon in these days; one of the most notable examples is Franklin D. Roosevelt who successfully took advantage of the image. As a president of the United States, he used his information that he was handicapped and i'll from the public. During this time, he used a wheelchair, and when making public speeches, he used a lectern to support himself and his weight. His strong image had successfully relieved his people throughout the wartime and depressions. Therefore, creating appealing images is important for today’s leaders, because it can easily spread to influence more people.

Moreover, some good images have been successfully used as advertising in many businesses. Specifically, Apple has differentiated its products on innovative design and created luxurious images among their products. Hence, Apple successfully has overridden other companies holding the number one spot for global smartphone sales. 

In brief, creating an appealing image has become more important than the reality or truth behind that image.	Thus, today's people must concern how others think and look at them.

________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	In this day and age, society is flooded with visual images of products and people. Advertisements are prevalent with the sole intention of selling products, and first impressions are very important. It is unfortunate that creating an appealing image has become more crucial than the truth behind the image.

	Indeed, in contemporary society, images sometimes do exist to reveal the reality behind the image. These images are authentic and visually help people understand its significance. To illustrate, during the Great Depression, a distinguished photographer, Dorothea Lange took candid photos to portray the stark reality of the depression. Lange’s Migrant Mother, a picture of a tired mother and her starving children on a farm, portrays a woman’s face mixed with worry and determination. This photograph depicts a family mired in poverty and reveals how they struggled each day to survive. Such an image inculcates the audience with the advertisement of living conditions of families and demonstrates the reality of the depression in the 1930s. It has no intention or false motives of creating an appealing image. Sometimes images exist to demonstrate the reality behind it.

	However, in more cases, creating an appealing image overrides displaying the reality behind the image. In particular, advertisements are popular in contemporary culture to stimulate and attract viewers to ultimately make them buy the products. To be specific, “The Marlboro Man”, which is an image of a cowboy in nature with solely a cigarette, advertises the popularity of filtered cigarettes. With no hint of the reality of the health concerns that are correlated with this product, the image is merely intended to sell Marlboro cigarettes. The truth behind smoking has been disclosed as the three men who advertised for Marlboro actually all died from lung cancer. Regardless of the truth, in a society filled with advertisements, most images are created to force people to focus on merely buying a stimulating image. Hence, no matter how unfortunate it may be, images are certainly created to be appealing.

	In addition to advertisements, artworks also demonstrate that more emphasis is placed on the appeal of an image. People tend to disregard the reality behind the image, which is a bit unfortunate. For example, the Mona Lisa, a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most popular paintings. People worldwide visit the Louvre to see this painting. The truth is that Napoleon Bonaparte kept the painting in his bedroom, and it went missing for two years. Partly because it was famously stolen and went missing for some time, its value increased significantly. Without considering the reality behind the image, a countless number of visitors line up to see the Mona Lisa due to its aesthetic appeal. It is unfortunate that people are attracted to this image because it is a single painting in bullet-proof glass isolated in a room all to itself. Instead of being interested in the reality behind the Mona Lisa, people are drawn to her appeal. Compared to the truth, creating an appeal plays a more vital role.

	In brief, it is an unfortunate situation that creating a stimulating image outweighs imparting knowledge and the truth. Thus, people should make continuous efforts to discover the truth.

To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.

[Brainstorm]

______________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]
	History has shown that the decisions made by leaders significantly influence their people. People admire their leaders; thus, it can be argued that maintaining ethics is a pivotal quality of a leader. However, having the highest ethical standards is not essential to be a successful leader. Rather than ethics, achievements can be more crucial to become an effective leader.

	Granted, maintaining the highest moral standards helps public officials become respectable leaders. George Washington, the first president of the United States, is a compelling example of an effective leader combined with the highest ethical standards. In the beginning of his presidency, he declined his salary because he valued his image as a selfless public servant. Washington was not involved in bribery, and he even declined serving a third presidential term. He did not abuse his authority, and his emphasis on the common good of the citizens revealed his commitment to ethics, which is why the public praised him in the past and continue to do so in the present. Thus, to be an effective leader, it is indispensable that a public official possesses high ethical and moral standards.

	However, in some cases, public leaders did not maintain the highest ethics, but they were still effective leaders. To illustrate, former President Bill Clinton was involved with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky during his presidency. He did not have ethics as he denied accusations and lied to the American citizens, but he is still regarded as an effective leader. Despite the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, which nearly resulted in the impeachment of Clinton, people still deem him as an effective leader. This is due to his successes in reviving the United States economy and helping minorities. Therefore, public officials who do not maintain the highest morals can still be effective leaders.

	Moreover, a leader does not need to maintain the highest morals since the economic, political, and social achievements can be more crucial in deciding whether a leader is effective. The Watergate Scandal took a toll on the presidency of Richard Nixon; however, such disregard to ethics does not deny the fact that he was an effective president. He successfully ended the Vietnam War and maintained amicable diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. Nixon is known for the Watergate Scandal, in which he infringed upon the privacy of the opposite party so that he could be re-elected as president. In such cases, maintaining the highest moral standards was not essential for public officials to be prominent leaders.

	In brief, although morals are pivotal in becoming an effective leader, a leader does not need the highest moral standards. Other factors, such as the economic, political, and social achievements, may overshadow ethics.

	Gaining the trust of its people is one of the most important tasks for leaders. Without the highest ethical and moral standards, people lose their trust and do not follow their leaders. However, I believe that most successful leaders are sometimes deceitful and misleading when those behaviors are vital for their people’s safety or nation’s stability.

	Admittedly, some effective leaders have outstanding moral standards. For example, former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela had attracted many people with his ethical behaviors. In his era, black people were segregated under a law called Apartheid; they attedned different schools, used low-quality bathrooms, and bus seats in the corner. Therefore, many furious people became violent and started uprises for their rights. However, Mandela started peaceful protests without violating any laws. Even though he was later incarcerated for 20 years, he remained ethical, writing books and papers, and persuaded many people to protest in peaceful ways. Laster, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent civil rights movements. To sum up, he became the epitome of an effective leader who maintained the highest moral standards. Thus, in some cases, leaders should have high ethical standards.

	However, most of the time, it is necessary to violate laws and deceive people for the sake of its people. Specifically, during World War II, the president of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt made many immoral decisions; one of the most controversial issues was the Manhattan Project studying nuclear weapons in order to end WWII. The government hired many scientists and invested more than two-million dollars and built many nuclear research sites around the world. In order to maintain its highest security, they deceive their people by telling them those research sites were irrelevant to the military and assayed the people.  The project was so secret that FDR did not even inform his fourth-term vice president, Truman, that it existed. If Roosevelt behaved morally and told the truth to his people, the project would have not terminated successfully and WWII might have prolonged. Thus, for the sake of its people, the US has deceived and misled their people and successfully ended a war.

	On top of that, immoral behaviors are sometimes pivotal in order to maintain the nation’s stability. During the Great Depression, Roosevelt had closed the banks and persuaded his people not to withdraw their money from banks. Even if he could not guarantee to recover the financial problems of banks, he decided to lie and told the banks they were safe. Therefore, many people gained trust in their banks and the US successfully overcame the depression. Now, Roosevelt is regarded as the most effective president in the US. Thus, highest moral standards are not necessary to be an effective leader.

	To sum up, moralistic behaviors are vital as people trust and follow trust-worthy leaders. However, sometimes, leaders should make immoral decisions for its people and the nation's stability.

In any profession—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years.

[Brainstorm]

Argument : Franklin D Roosevelt -
Argument : Global Warming - Government will focus on short-term goal
________________________________________________________________________________________	[essay_Sean]

	People in the highest position tend to be satisfied with their current success and often be narrow-minded. Therefore, many business people with an unconventional, fresh idea often overthrow old, traditional people. However, for government and politics, people should be in charge of more than five years to see things in different directions.

	Admittedly, many businesses change their leaders or restructure their workers. It is because when someone only focuses on one job, they easily lose track of the current change happening outside. For example, in machine learning, which is one of the most state-of-the-art technologies in computer science, new findings always renovate its application. Specifically, Google has recently released Tensorflow, which antiquated most of other existing machine-learning research. Thus, it is reasonable to say that leaders in the fast-changing business should not overstay in their positions.

On the other hand, in most other professions it requires a lot of experience and patience in order for a leader to shine. For example, one of the most renowned leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt has served as the United States’ president for over four terms; over the 12 years, he went through all the difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II. He successfully overcame those difficulties with his long-term pledge called New Deal. It would have been impossible for Roosevelt to fully carry out a New Deal if he only served for five years. Moreover, during his campaign, the most popular slogan was “Don’t change horses in midstream”. The slogan emphasizes the confusion and disorder of people when leaders change. As we can see from history, it is important for people to wait and support leaders over a long time.

Lastly, if every leader steps down after five years, leaders will only focus on the short term outcomes without considering the future. In previous decades, many countries have focused on their countries’ development. Specifically, over the last century, the earth’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit and global sea level rose about 8 inches. It is because when it comes to evaluating a leader, people usually focus on their current achievement, not predict future effects. Similarly, in sports, where coaches are contracted over a short-term, most coaches only focus on winning a game with the most skillful players without giving opportunities to other promising players. So, there is a World Cup defending champion jinx because every previous champion of the World Cup failed to make the quarterfinals. Therefore, for the sake of the groups’ futures, a leader must remain in his position for a long time.

In summary, although the freshness of new blood often vitalizes the group in businesses, it requires patience for leaders to carry out their plans. People in various leadership positions should not be changed so frequently so that they take full responsibility for their actions.

When old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes, modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings.
						
________________________________________________________________________________________
[essay_ann]

	Due to technological advancement, many people believe in the advantages that can be offered by modern development. Modern planners may argue that old buildings hamper urban development and the significant benefits that can be yielded. However, I believe that historic buildings should be protected because these buildings can be helpful for the economy. Also, historic buildings are embedded with cultural significance.

	It can be admitted that modern development should be given precedence over the protection of historic buildings. Proponents to urban development may argue that demolishing these historical sites and creating new buildings would lead to population growth and economic gain. These days, overpopulation is becoming a pressing problem, so creating buildings can be the optimal solution. New homes can be created to induce residents to move in, and factories and commercial buildings can be built to attract employers and employees. With the advantages that urban planning can offer, it seems somewhat credible to assert the importance of modern development.

	However, it should be noted that the preservation of historic buildings does not come at the expense of economic development. Opponents to urban development may claim that protecting existing buildings would take a toll on the economy because it would not allow for industrial development. These critics argue for the demolition of old houses and historic buildings. Nevertheless, people must realize that these historic buildings are a major part of the revenue gained by the city. For example, the Colosseum in Rome attracts millions of tourists annually. Even though it has been partially damaged by earthquakes and other incidents, it still represents Rome and has been listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Getting rid of the Colosseum would have an adverse impact on Rome and its economy, which is why it has and will be preserved for decades. Old buildings should be preserved for industrial gain.

	Moreover, historic buildings should be protected because of their cultural significance. To be specific, the Forbidden City in the center of Beijing is preserved to portray the home of the Emperor and his household as well as the political center of the Chinese government. People worldwide visit the Forbidden City to understand Chinese history and also to comprehend the cultural values of China in the past and in the present day and age. If modern planners believed that it could be better used for modern purposes and destroyed the existing buildings, a significant part of Chinese culture would be lost. Obviously, these historic buildings have remained for decades for these reasons, and the government has thus taken extensive measures to protect the buildings and preserve its culture.

	In summary, the preservation of historic buildings should be given precedence over modern development. Old buildings have economical and cultural significance that cannot be replaced by other buildings.

In most professions and academic fields, imagination is more important than knowledge.

[brainstorm]

[essay_ann]

	In our current society, possessing creative skills and understanding facts are both needed, so it can be debatable whether imagination is more important than knowledge. I agree with the claim that imagination overrides knowledge in most professions and academic fields.

	Granted, in a few fields, knowledge can be imperative. This is because people need to understand numerical and historical facts and concepts to succeed in their professions. Doctors are a part of a few professions that require knowledge. They go through extensive schooling to learn concepts that will be useful to their everyday work. Similarly, the field of mathematics is based solely on numbers and facts; thus, imagination is not vital in creating theories and solving equations. Mathematicians, such as Pythagoras, relied more on facts and realistic concepts rather than imagination as they spend endless hours in their rooms to devise theorems. Math teachers and professors do not use their imagination and instead place emphasis on their knowledge to learn the rules of math and inculcate their students with math formulas. Thus, knowledge can be more important in a few fields.

	However, in most fields, knowledge pales in comparison with imagination. The importance of creativity can be proven in a majority of fields, including the field of science. Long ago, people adamantly believed that human flight was not possible. Since the majority of people adhere to this form of knowledge, advanced modes of transportation were not prevalent. However, the Wright Brothers had emphasized their imagination and decided to castigate this ubiquitous view. With their creativity, they were able to think beyond the possibilities and devised an airplane that focused on the combination of the engine, wings, and propellers. As a result, long-term flight is now possible. Since the forerunners in the field of science believed the role of imagination was crucial, our society is able to enjoy cutting-edge technology. Thus, imagination is more important in a majority of fields.

	In addition to the field of science, the field of business further proves that imagination is more important than knowledge. Many businesses and entrepreneurs are prevalent in our current society, but only a few who can constantly create new products can climb the ladder of success. In particular, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, succeeded due to his creativity. Since he emphasized the design of computers and cell phones and focused on the crucial role of aesthetics in public appeal, Apple products are popular worldwide. He did not limit himself to the boundaries of society and broadened his horizons to think like no one else. Through creativity, he increased his company’s sales and prospered as an entrepreneur. In many fields, including business, imagination is a vital factor.

	In brief, although knowledge is needed, imagination is more crucial in the majority of professions. Along with scientists and businessmen, many more professions including artists and musicians would need creativity. Thus, people should foster their imagination in their daily lives.

[essay_ann]

	In our society, there are many elements that make a successful country. Many people may think that general welfare is crucial. Nevertheless, the surest indicator of a great nation is represented by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists.

	Admittedly, general well-being is important when determining a great nation. This is because governments need to implement solid welfare policies on behalf of the citizens. Take Switzerland for example. It possesses a social welfare system that provides citizens with a subsidized health care, including maternity benefits. Also, long-term nursing care and old-age pensions are readily available by the state. Great social benefits are provided to the citizens since the government allocates a significant share of its budget to its social welfare spending. Due to general welfare benefits given to its citizens, many people regard Switzerland as a great nation where people can live happy lives. Thus, in a few cases, the general well-being of all its people can indicate how great a nation is.

	However, the achievements of great people, especially rulers, are the surest indicator of a great nation. Political leaders need to accomplish much so that their people can reap the benefits of their political achievements. To illustrate, many prominent leaders in the United States have been successful, so the US is a great nation. To be specific, Franklin D. Roosevelt. can be seen as a pioneer of US history. He implemented the New Deal Plan during the Great Depression. Roosevelt went the extra mile to emphasize government intervention and helped citizens recover from the adverse economic conditions. Because of his many political achievements, he ensured a sound economy and prosperous lives for his people, and the United States became a great nation. Thus, achievements by famous rulers can contribute to the nation being heralded as great.

	Moreover, the surest indicator of a great nation is determined by the achievements of leaders, particularly scientists. At a time when human flight seemed merely impossible, the Wright Brothers invented and built the world’s first successful airplane. They focused on the combination of the engine, wings, and propellers. Eventually the brothers made controlled, powered and sustained flight possible. Their scientific achievements guaranteed convenient lives for the majority of US citizens and helped the US to be a leading power in the world, not only in the political sphere but also the scientific arena. Thus, the achievements of distinguished scientists can be the surest indicator of a great nation.

	In summary, although the well-being of its individual citizens might be considered important, the achievements of leaders, particularly rulers and scientists, certainly indicate a great nation. In this fast-paced society, a country needs to make significant accomplishments to be praised by other countries.

[essay_ann]

In this globalized society, some people would think that cooperation is an essential asset. Others believe that their competitive nature is important so that they would be eager to achieve more than others. In the field of government, the ability to cooperate with others would be more beneficial. However, leaders in many fields, such as business and sports, should be highly competitive to succeed.

Granted, successful government leaders must be willing to cooperate with others so that they can embrace differences and work together. As Aesop once said, “In union there is strength.” NASA and other government organizations instill in their employees a sense of cooperation. These employees work together for the greater good of society, and teamwork helps them to progress. A competitive drive would only hinder them from advancing. Likewise, Richard Nixon is praised by numerous people due to his ability to cooperate with other political leaders and nations. Nixon is known for his teamwork skills as he successfully ended the Vietnam War and maintained amicable diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. At a time when the United States had rocky relations with communist nations, he was willing to sign treaties with these two countries. Due to his willingness to collaborate with other political leaders, he became a successful leader. All things considered, cooperation is a vital factor for leaders to succeed in governmental affairs.

However, leaders in industry would accomplish more with the ability to compete with other leaders and companies. Take the leaders of Apple and Samsung for example. With cutting-edge technology, Apple had created the I-phone. Soon after, Samsung’s Galaxy entered the global market for consumer mobile communications. Each year the company’s leader prepares a new smart phone, each boasting upgraded features. Due to such fierce competition between these two companies and leaders, consumers have been able to choose from a wide array of selections. There have been continuous battles, and with the intense rivalry, consumers can expect such devices to improve even more in the long run. Hence, business leaders should be highly competitive to succeed.

In addition to business leaders, sports leaders who climb the ladder of success are highly competitive. This is because competition instills in people the natural desire to succeed in life. For example, Japanese figure skater Asada Mao and South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim have been rivals for many years. Being the same age and two young athletes from neighboring countries, both have competed in many of the same competitions. With Mao winning first place in their first competitions, she has acted as an impetus to Kim to hone her skating skills. Because the two athletes are highly competitive, they have made endeavors to prove their talent. Without such rivalry, it may have been a much more arduous task for Kim to receive the gold medal in the Winter Olympics. Thus, sports leaders should be competitive to accomplish much.

In brief, although cooperation has its benefits, it is ultimately better for industry and sports leaders to be competitive.  The continuous will to compete with others fosters success. People in various leadership positions should thus embrace rivalry.

Some people believe that corporations have a responsibility to promote the well-being of the societies and environments in which they operate. Others believe that the only responsibility of corporations, provided they operate within the law, is to make as much money as possible.

essay_ann

	Many companies worldwide compete with each other to provide better products for their customers. Along with such fierce competition, companies race to the bottom and reduce wages and living standards for workers to improve profit. Although some might think that corporations exist only to make a profit, I adamantly believe that companies should promote the well-being of the societies in which they operate.

	Indeed, the function of a corporation is to make as much money as possible. This is because profit is the ultimate goal, and companies base their success on how much profit they can gain. For example, an internationally recognized company Samsung has many factories in underdeveloped countries. In order to produce a variety of products, ranging from smartphones to electronics, Samsung uses a cheap source of labor for their production lines. As long as it does not infringe upon the law, the goal to maximize its profit can be a worthy one. In this way, Samsung can yield benefits by not only making high profit, but also providing consumers with a wide range of cutting-edge technological devices and products. All things considered, abiding by the law and making as much money as possible can be one duty of lucrative corporations.

	However, in more cases, corporations have a responsibility to significantly contribute to the well-being of the societies. Most nations would agree that the welfare of the public is a top priority. Take Burt’s Bees for example. All their employees are dedicated to making a difference in their communities by participating in community outreach. The company places emphasis on environmentally-friendly practices not only within their company, but also with their partners and the surrounding communities. Also, Burt’s Bees are famous for their products since they are derived from natural ingredients. In many respects, Burt’s Bees have fostered the well-being of society, so improving the environments in which they operate should be the responsibility of other companies too.

	Moreover, further cases prove that promoting the well-being of the society is essential. Companies operate in specific environments, so they should work towards ameliorating the conditions of the society. Many automobile companies in the past have remodeled their original automobiles and created new models so that they can boost their sales and eventually profit. Although revenue is important in this day and age, more people are stressing the importance of the environment. Corporations have a responsibility to develop the wellness of society, so car companies are taking extensive measures to make hybrid cars and electric cars to lower emissions and reduce pollution that is emitted. Therefore, the betterment of society should be a priority for firms.

	In brief, more examples prove that promoting the well-being of society should be given in the hands of corporations. After all, people should be responsible for issues that affect the society at large.

To study growth rate, the scientists used an extensive array of fossils, documenting the changes in bone density over time in members of the same clade, or species that have evolved from some common ancestor. For the most part, they found a consistent relationship: dinosaurs grew not nearly as fast as modern day endotherms or nearly as slowly as poikilotherms, which all reptiles are. For example, an archaeopteryx (an early flying dinosaur) reached maturity after two years, whereas a modern red-tailed hawk needs only six weeks to do so.
	
	The passage mentions the red-tailed hawk in order to indicate

that dinosaurs were cold-blooded
how birds share a similar clade with other dinosaurs
the way in which some modern day animals differ from dinosaurs
how markedly dinosaurs’ growth rate differed from that of current species
the shift from poikilothermy to endothermy in most species

Paragraph Argument
[Don’t assume anything]

State park officials recently released a report urging hikers in Rockridge Mountain Park to exercise caution during the months of April and May. According to the report, the number of mountain lion sightings in the park reaches its peak in the months of April and May.

All of the following could account for the increased number of mountain lion sightings EXCEPT

During April and May, which feature the best hiking weather of the year, more people visit the park than during any other time of year.
Throughout the year, local newspapers report any mountain lion sightings, and most reports come during the months of April and May.
The red-tailed deer, the mountain lion’s primary food source, is most abundant during these months and tends to favor hiking trails.
In spring, the trail conditions are best for mountain bikers, who, because they make less noise than hikers, are more likely to startle mountain lions.
Creek beds high in the mountains tend to dry up in spring, so mountain lions often descend into the lower elevations, where hikers are more common.

[Don’t forget the Conclusion]
Motorvation recently designed the Ambi, which it hopes will appeal to those looking for an affordable hybrid vehicle. The costs to produce the Ambi, however, outweigh the revenue Motorvation expects to make from the Ambi in the coming year. Nonetheless, Motorvation is confidant that the Ambi will ultimately become one of its most profitable vehicles.

Which of the following, if true, supports Motorvation’s expectations regarding the Ambi?

Some of the parts used to make the Ambi will be used on another line of cars that Motorvation expects to be highly profitable.
Five years ago Motorvation released the High-Brid, which, despite not achieving profitability in its first year, became Motorvation’s most popular car two years later.
The majority of the Ambi’s production costs came from research and development, costs Motorvation will be able to recoup within eighteen months of the Ambi’s release.
