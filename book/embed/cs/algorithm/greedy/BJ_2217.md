* If multiple ropes are connected in parallel, the weight of each rope can be divided
* When the object in which the weight is w is lifted by using the rope of k, it altogether evens, the weight as much as the w / k hangs on each rope
* When information is given about each rope, use these ropes to create a program to obtain the maximum weight of an object that can be lifted
* You do not have to use all the ropes, and you can use a few ropes at will.
