* When the meat is frozen and the temperature is less than 0°C: the temperature rises 1°C in C second
* When the meat is frozen and the temperature is exactly 0°C: it takes D seconds to make it unfrozen (thawing)
* When the meat is not frozen: the temperature rises by 1°C in E second
* find how many seconds it takes for the meat to warm to B°C
