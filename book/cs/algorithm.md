* Big O

```text
o (strictly faster)  # f(n) = o(g(n))
f(n) ∈ O(g(n)) and f(n) ∉ θ(g(n))

O (upper)            # f(n) = O(g(n))
∃ positive constants c and k, such that f(n) <= cg(n) for all n >= k.
```

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \neq \infty \Rightarrow f=O(g)
$$

* Big Omega

```text
Omega (lower)    f(n) = Ω(g(n))
∃ positive constants c and k such that f(n) >= c * g(n) for all n >= k
```

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \neq 0 \Rightarrow f=\Omega(g)
$$

* Big Theta

```text
θ (average)    f(n) = θ(g(n))
∃ positive constants c1, c2 and k such that c1 * g(n) ≤ f(n) <= c2 * g(n) for all n >= k
```

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \neq 0, \infty \Rightarrow f=\theta(g)

### Hashable

### Sort

> Selction Sort

* Code

```py
def selection_sort(a1 … an):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        am = minimum(ai, ..., an) 
        swap ai and am
```

* Proof

```text
Loop invariant: After t loop, the first t elements are (1) sorted, (2) minimum
Base: It is true when t = 0, because there is no element.
Inductive Hypothesis: For some t iterations, the first t elements are (1) sorted, (2) minimum

SIH: For k iteration where k = 1 … t, the k elements are (1) sorted, (2) minimum
WTS: For t + 1 iteration, the first t + 1 elements are (1) sorted, (2) minimum

During the (t + 1)st iteration, the algorithm finds am, the minimum value of at+1, …, am and swap with at+1. So, after the (t + 1)st iteration, at+1 is the minimum value of at+1, ..., an

We have a1, ..., at are all less than at+1 and at+1 is minimum of at+1, ..., an ⇒  (1)
We have a1, …, at are in the sorted order and all less than at+1 ⇒ (2)

Therefore: for any 0 ≤ t ≤ n - 1, the loop invariant is true after t iterations.

Since we execute the loop exactly n times, the loop invariant with t = n guarantees that all n elements of the list will be in the correct order at the end of the algorithm.
```

> Merge Sort

* code

```text
procedure MergeSort(a1, …, an):
    if n == 0:
        return ()
    if n == 1:
        return (a1)
    m = ⌊n | 2⌋
    L1 = MergeSort(a1, …, am)
    L2 = MergeSort(am+1, …, an)
    return RMerge(L1, L2)

procedure RMerge(a1, …, ak, b1, …, bl: sorted lists)
    if first list is empty:  return b1, …, bl
    if second list is empty: return a1, …, ak
    if a1 ≤ b1:  return a1 · RMerge(a2, …, ak, b1, …, bl)
    else:        return b1 · RMerge(a1, …,ak, b2, …, bl)
```

* Proof

```text
Base : Suppose n=0. Then both lists are empty. Vacuously true.
Induction : Suppose n ≥ 1 and RMerge(a1, ..., ak, b1,...,bl) returns a sorted list containing
all elements from either list whenever k + l = n - 1
WTS : RMerge(a1, ..., ak, b1, ..., bl) returns a sorted list containing all elements from either list
whenever k + l = n.

# Inductive step
Case 1: at least one of the lists is empty. 
  Similar to base case. In the first or second line, return all of the elements, in sorted order.
Case 2 : neither list empty and a1 ≤ b1
  Since both lists are sorted, this means a1 is the smallest overall. The total size of the input of 
  RMerge(a2, ... , ak, b1, ... , bl) is (k - 1) + l = n - 1 so by the IH, it returns a sorted list containing all 
  elements from either list. Adding a1 to the start maintains the order and gives a sorted list with all 
elements.
Case 3 : neither list empty and b1 ≤ a1
  WLOG same as case 2

# Strong Induction
Base case : Suppose n=0. Then, return the empty list, (trivially) sorted. 
SIH : MergeSort correctly sorts all lists with k elements, for any 0 ≤ k < n
Goal : prove that MergeSort(a1, ..., an) returns a sorted list containing all n elements.
Induction Step : Suppose n=1. Then, return a1, a (trivially) sorted list containing all elements.
```

```

```text
modular multiplicative inverse is an integer 'x' such that.

a x ≅ 1 (mod m)

The multiplicative inverse of “a modulo m” exists iff a and m are relatively prime.

Examples: Input: a = 3, m = 11
Output: 4
Explanation: Since (4*3) mod 11 = 1, 4 is modulo inverse of 3(under 11)
```

* Convex Set
  * Given any collection of convex sets (finite, countable or uncountable), their intersection is a convex set

```text
Proof: If the intersection is empty, or consists of a single point, the theorem is true by definition.
Otherwise, take any two points A, B in the intersection. The line AB joining these points must also lie wholly within each set in the collection, hence must lie wholly within their intersection.

> Exchange Argument

* OS be a solution achieved by not choosing g.
* Show how to transform OS into some solution OS' that chooses g, and that is at least as good as OS.

1. Say G is the event with the earliest finish time. (First greedy decision: include G).
2. Let OS be a legal schedule that doesn't include G such that $$ |OS'| \geq |OS|%0 $$
3. Let the events in OS be $$ j_1, ..., j_k%0 $$ ordered by start and finish times ( $$ J_1 \neq G%0 $$ ) (Exchange Arg)
    * Must show that OS' is a valid solution
    * OS' is better than OS

* Use 1-3 in an inductive argument

```text
Base case : the greedy strategy works for an instance of size 1. 
IH : Assume the greedy works for all instances of size < n.
```

$$ |O S(I)| \leq\left|O S^{\prime}(I)\right|=\left|\{g\} \cup S\left(I^{\prime}\right)\right| \leq\left|\{g\} \cup G S\left(I^{\prime}\right)\right|=|G S(I)|%0 $$

visited time ≤ low time of adjacent vertex
```

> Cycle Detect

* An undirected connected graph G has a cycle if and only if it’s DFS output tree has a back edge.
* Complexity    O(V + E)

* Proof

```text
→ 
Suppose DFS tree has no back edge. Then all of the original edges are in the DFS tree. Then the graph itself is a tree (no cycles)

←
Suppose the graph is a tree (has no cycles) then there can’t be any backedges, because the DFS output tree is a tree with all the vertices.
```

### Path

* [DFS BFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk)

> BFS

* Algorithm

```text
procedure BFS(G, s)
    for each vertex u in V:
        dist(u)=∞
    dist(s) = 0
    Q = [s] (queue just containing s)
    while Q is not empty
        u = eject(Q)
            for all edges (u,v) in E
                if dist(v)=∞ then
                    inject(Q,v)
                    dist(v)=dist(u) + 1
```

* Proof

```text
After BFS is done, dist(v) is the length of the shortest path from s to v
→ After every iteration, dist(v) is the length of some path from s to v.

loop invariant
← After BFS is done, dist(v) is the length of the shortest path from s to v for all vertices v in V.

Suppose there is a path p from s to v such that length(p) < dist(v)
Then let z be the last vertex in the path s.t. dist(z) = d(z) and let w be the first vertex in thee path s.t. dist(w) > d(w)

Case 1: d(w) = d(z) + 1. Then in the algorithm z is put in the queue before q and when z is ejected, w is injected with dist(w) = 
Case 2: d(w) > d(z) + 1. Then the path p is actually not the shortest path.

# Complexity
Notice that in BFS, each vertex enters the queue (F) at most one time.
This was the assumption we made about graph search when we calculated its Complexity.
So BFS runs in O V + E time.
```

> DFS

* Algorithm

```py
def dfs(i, j):
    if 0 <= i < len(G) and 0 <= j < len(G[0]) and G[i][j] == '1':
        G[i][j] = '0'
        list(map(dfs, (i+1, i-1, i, i), (j, j, j+1, j-1)))
        return 1
    return 0
```

* Proof

```text
After BFS is done, dist(v) is the length of the shortest path from s to v
→ After every iteration, dist(v) is the length of some path from s to v.

loop invariant
← After BFS is done, dist(v) is the length of the shortest path from s to v for all vertices v in V.

Suppose there is a path p from s to v such that length(p) < dist(v)
Then let z be the last vertex in the path s.t. dist(z) = d(z) and let w be the first vertex in thee path s.t. dist(w) > d(w)

Case 1: d(w) = d(z) + 1. 
Then in the algorithm z is put in the queue before q and when z is ejected, w is injected with dist(w) = 
Case 2: d(w) > d(z) + 1. 
Then the path p is actually not the shortest path.

This was the assumption we made about graph search when we calculated its Complexity.
So BFS runs in O V + E time.

* Doesn't work for negative edge weight
